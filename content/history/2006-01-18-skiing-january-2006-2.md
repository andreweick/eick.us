Took the girls skiing up in northern Michigan this weekend.  It was reasonably cold, but just no snow at all up there!  All the snow was man made and I'm not a good enough skier to navigate it.  The second day the slopes were so bad I had to knock off early, but it was still fun to be out with my brother in law Pete and nephew Marc.  We've been going skiing on MLK day for 7-8 years now.  The girls had so much fun.  Libby kept saying "Swimming.....Pool"  "Swimming....Pool"  "Bathing Suit.....Bathing Suit."  Libby had no fear, she jumped right down the steps.  Jazz wasn't so sure.  The first night she wouldn't even step off the first step, but by the second day she was jumping in and out of the water.
