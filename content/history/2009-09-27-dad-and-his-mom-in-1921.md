This picture was taken of mom and me one Sunday morning after mass.   I don't think I've sent it to you.  I wasn't old enough to drive and mom did not like to drive.  So we went to mass with neighbors, the Hartmann's.  Mr. Hartmann was our car insurance agent and lived about 1/2 mile from us.  Behind us is our car, a 1939 Dodge which my dad bought used before he died unexpectedly.  WWII was in progress, and cars weren't being made.  Some 1942 model cars were still in the showroom, upon blocks to protect the tires.  I used to look with envy at them when my dad took me to tha garage with him to get the car worked on.   We always waited while the car work was done.  To buy one of those new cars you needed to prove you needed it for some purpose that would further the war effort and get approval from the rationing board.Mom looks weary.  I'm sure the weight of the world was upon her as she wrestled with our future, i.e., could she and should she stay on the farm; could she meet expenses; should she go to work in Rock Island, and if she did, what about the driving, etc.
