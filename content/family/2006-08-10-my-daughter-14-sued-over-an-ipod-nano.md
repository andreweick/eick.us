The remarkable aspect of this case is that the dispute involves an iPod Nano – not even an iPod Video.  On their final day of 8th grade, in an act that teenagers repeat millions of times per year, Shannon lent Stephanie her iPod.  In a she-said, she-said between 14-year olds there is then a dispute over what happened next.  According to my daughter she **returned the iPod by placing it in Shannon’s purse on her desk while Shannon was in the room.  Shannon then left her iPod and purse unattended** and went to the bathroom.  While she was gone the class bell rang and when she came back the iPod and students were gone.

According to both Shannon (and Ms. McCarthy), Stephanie returned it while Shannon was in the bathroom.  Q. How would either Shannon, who was in the bathroom or her mother who wasn’t there, know what happened?  They claim that my daughter is responsible and have sued her for $350 for an iPod Nano, iTunes, and case – wow this seems pretty expensive, particularly since the iTunes are still on their computer.

**Did we have any warning that a suite coming?  No!** Ms. McCarthy did call us once back in June.  She spoke with Susan Eick, Stephanie’s mom.  The call was sort of awkward since Ms. McCarthy lectured Susan about parental responsibility.  At this point we didn’t know anything about a lost iPod and needed to investigate.  There were no other calls, emails, or messages to either me or Susan before we were served with a court Summons.  The night we got served I called Ms. McCarthy and offered to split the cost of a new iPod.  She declined and said that she would see me in court.

I should point out that Still Middle School rules strictly prohibit the use of iPods at school.

We’ve become suit happy when we look around for someone to sue when an unfortunate incident happens.  I feel that it’s unfair of Shannon to blame Stephanie when left the iPod unattended.  It would have been better if Stephanie handed the iPod to Shannon rather than putting it in her purse on her desk.  Stephanie did not take it.  I would agree with shared culpability which is why I offered to split the cost.
