This video that Dad made in the late 60's of the Disney Teacups reminded me of a video I took on my iPhone of Libby and Jasmine at Disney last year, so I spliced them together.  Dad, do you remember when this was?  Who the kids were?  Is that Chris and Tim?  Was Peter the baby or was I?  (1964-ish or 1968-ish)?  I think it is Disney in California, so you must have been visiting Aunt Mary.

Update from Dad:
---------------

John & Chris are in one cup; Steve is in a cup by himself. Steve made the cup go so fast he was dizzy upon exit.

We did not have video Fall '64, so this had to be the trip to Disneyland after a summer in Los Alamos.  We bought the camper in Albuquerque, went to CA and then camped back through national parks to MI--a three week trip.  Probably late summer 1966.
