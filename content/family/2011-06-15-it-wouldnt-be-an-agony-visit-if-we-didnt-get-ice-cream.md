With Agony here, and the weather almost a 100, we had to go get ice cream.  Agony has his game face on as he picks out ice cream, while Jasmine is just along for the ride.  Libby ordered the blue ice cream, and proceeded to get it on her dress (she was dressed in matching outfits with her American Girl Doll).  The ice cream wasn't as good as Moomers, but it'll do....
