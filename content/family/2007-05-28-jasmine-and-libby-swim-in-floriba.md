A quick video I made in "Flor-i-ba" of the girls swimming.  Libby had so much fun in the "baby pool", she would just sit in the water and sing.  She'd swim from one end of the pool to the other, and then run around, and then jump in the other side -- she'd do that over and over and over again.  Jasmine really liked the "big girl pool."  She could jump in, and she learned to swim under water.
