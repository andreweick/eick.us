Libby, Denise, Jasmine and our friend Nicole did "Girls on the Run", a 5K race, this year. 

Jasmine was pretty tired, she had 4 soccer games Saturday, and then ran the race in 28:50, then made it back in time for another 3 games (and her team won the tournament)

Libby really worked hard at her race.  She told me she was going to try to compose a song and write a play during her race.  And Denise said she wanted to stop and take a picture at every mile marker.  Libby finished in 51:31
