We've had season tickets to the Michigan State football games since before I was born.  (I asked the guy I sit next to how long we've had these same seats and he said 'Well, 40 years ago we moved down a row, but I don't remember before that...')  I think Dad looked it up a few years ago and we had the seats for 43 years...

  

We only have two seats, so Jasmine and I go.  I keep trying to talk Libby into going -- she says she will, but then she backs out at the last second.  Jasmine likes to go and

     1. Go to the 'toy' bookstore -- she gets to pick out notebook and pencils so she can do her paperwork during the game 

    2. Eat a pretzel 

    3. Walk up the ramp 

    4. See the marching band (and maybe march) 

    5. Go to the 'book' bookstore. 

    6. Sing songs in the car 

   

This time she wanted to wear her cheerleader costume, and the whole drive up to East Lansing she practiced "go green / go white".  Of course, when she met the cheerleading squad walking into the stadium, she couldn't say a word.

Behind the library, on your way to the stadium, there is a ventilation grate that blows steam out of the building.  Jasmine had so much fun walking across the grate that she went back and forth several times.  Only a few games ago she wouldn't even go near the thing.

After the game, she wanted "A sandwich, chippies, and soda"  Usually she takes the sandwich and just eats the meat, but this time she ate the whole thing.  She was so excited!

  

Usually, she sits in the stands, [draws pictures](http://blog-family.andyeick.com/CategoryView,category,Jasmine%2BPictures.aspx) for everyone around us, watches the marching band, and then wants to leave -- she'll last maybe a quarter and halftime.  When we left (start of the third quarter) we were ahead and driving, so I can only assume we won the game.
