Since we are going to visit Agony in Arizona for vacation this week, we had an Easter egg hunt early for the girls.

Libby was the most excited to go outside and look for eggs...

Libby looking out the winter, waiting for the snow to be gone ("I tired of winter, Daddy...")  Don't worry Lib, summer is only a plane ride away in Arizonia (as she says).  The girls are playing "vacation" where they load up all the poly pockets on thomas the train, and then ride to Aridzona (as I say).
