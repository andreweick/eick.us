Libby explaining the Easter Bunny from 2010.

Libby explains that the Bunny comes in on the second floor and then rides a balloon down to the ground.  

Jasmine says that can't possibly happen and that the bunny comes in through the front door.

This year they were both pretty sure the Bunny didn't exist, but since they both really wanted American Girl Doll clothes, they didn't want to take any chances...
