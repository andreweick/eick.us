We took Jasmine and Libby to a colonial farm this past weekend.  Libby starts in costume, she wore the bonnet that she had just gotten at Mount Vernon.  Jasmine wanted to see the tobacco farms.  They both liked the market best of all, and went to the stalls and picked out rock candy, and new dresses to wear.  They put on the dresses right away and wore them the rest of the day.  It was really hot, so they couldn't have been that happy.  They liked the puppet show, but really didn't like the fencing demonstration.  Libby get's scared of fighting, even if it's pretend.I made the movie on my iPhone, and edited it together in the car driving back.  The place was only 10 minutes from the house -- nice to live inside the beltway, everything is close!
