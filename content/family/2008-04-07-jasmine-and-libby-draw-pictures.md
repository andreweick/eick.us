Libby is moving into non-representational phase

Pure abstraction, in a washed pastel. 

  

Â 

  

While Jasmine moves into representational (crayon on placemat)

Jasmine is in the middle, and notice the green sun, rainbow (a motif of hers) and the camel (we saw 2 camels that day)

She wrote her name, I think it is Jasmine and Daddy, and rainbows again
