We went down to [Outer Banks, NC](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Duck,+NC&hl=en&ll=36.168923,-75.750732&spn=2.67383,4.251709&sll=36.06461,-75.705735&sspn=0.083674,0.132866&oq=duck,&hnear=Duck,+Dare,+North+Carolina&t=m&z=8) for a long weekend.  It was pretty windy, but the girls loved playing on the beach. The hotel we stayed at had both a pool and was right on the beach, so Libby was very happy going from one to the next.  It was pretty windy, but they did go out and play in the surf.We went to see a [the lost colony](http://www.outerbanks.org/outerbanks-the-lost-colony/), and the [Kitty Hawk](http://www.nps.gov/wrbr/index.htm).   I think Jasmine's favorite was building the sandcastle and the gift shop, and Libby liked the pizza and swimming.
