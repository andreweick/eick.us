Last weekends game.  It was so cold!  Mary, Pete, Fred, and Grandma were here to watch Jasmine's game, and they didn't get a warm Virginia day at all.  All the Emerald Dragons are at the [team site](http://eick.us/emerald-dragons), with a direct link to all the pictures from the [April 28th game](http://eick.us/emerald-dragons/#/13/0).  If you want to be notified by email when I post a new game [sing up](http://eepurl.com/lhf_9)
