Jasmine is getting more complicated with the pictures she is drawing!  She drew the whole family, but then she had to add "Mommy's comb" and "Jasmine's comb."  And it looks like she added a pipe for Grandpa Eick, but I'm sure she doesn't know what a pipe is, so I think those are just extraneous marks....
