Jasmine laughing like crazy while Libby tries to pose.[![Jasmine and Libby mug for camera](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/4376074424_f3b0ab81a4.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/4376074424/)Jasmine poses against a dark background.[![Jasmine laughs for camera](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/4375326371_99538005db.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/4375326371/)Libby lays down and looks into the light.[![Libby laying down](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/4375327309_c0e21a6a2d.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/4375327309/)It's been snow and snow and snow in D.C.  Last year I think it snowed once, and the snow didn't stay past noon, this year the girls have been out of school for over a week straight.  Obama shut down the government for a week (and he works at home, so it must have been bad).  The subway was closed, our subdivision wasn't plowed for a week, and we lost power for 2 full days.[![Jasmine and Libby with snow](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/4376078278_dc10379266.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/4376078278/)[![Jasmine and Libby in snow cave](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/4376078982_08e6c5a8f6.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/4376078982/)
