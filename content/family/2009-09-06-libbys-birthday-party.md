On one of our last weekends as Michigan residents, we had Libby's 5th birthday party, and the girls had a piano recital the next day.  Libby wanted a horesey birthday party (of course), so we had the party at a petting zoo.  Libby liked her "cowgirl party" so much that she wore her birthday girl bandana to her recital.  Actually, even today, she still wears her birthday bandana...<br /><br />
