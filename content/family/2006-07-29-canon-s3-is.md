[![Maria](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/198452263_533796b54c_m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/andreweick/198452263/)I just picked up the [Canon S3 IS](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canons3is/) camera<http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/198452263/>.  When we went to Europe I bought a little Nikon camera for Denise to use, but was really disappointed in the quality of the pictures.  After reading the reviews it seemed the S3 was a nice middle ground between a DSLR and a point-n-shoot.  What I like about it so far is the size — it’s much smaller than my D5, so I find I carry it with me more places.  I’ve never wanted a video camera (I work hard enough to get 1 frame right, I give up at 30 frames a second), but the video mode is fun to take pictures of Jasmine and Libby.



The picture at right I took with the S3, as are all [my videos](http://blog.andyeick.com/CategoryView,category,video.aspx).



All in all this is the perfect camera for the job.  It takes good pictures, and let’s you have full manual control.  What I don’t like about the camera are the view finder (When zooming, I still have trouble ‘controlling’ where I am looking.  (Possibly because I’m used to ‘turning to zoom”?)  My thinking is that because the view finder is just a monitor, it doesn’t refresh as cleanly.  I get around the problem by just using the ‘flip out monitor’ on the back of the camera.



The nikon is now Jasmine’s camera, and I’m sure it’s good enough to take pictures of her thumb.
