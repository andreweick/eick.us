I read this article on the plane the other day (darn those electronic-less 15 minutes during takeoff and landing!).  Add Ford to the list of companies with Adoption benefits, in that they gave me an money when I adopted [Jasmine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/tags/favoritejasmine/show/).  I actually had no idea Ford offered this, until my friend pointed it out to me when I got back from China!  I think they gave me a similar amount of money as a reward for my patent.

Adoption has become an employment issue.  With each adoption costing up to $30,000 and often demanding mounds of paperwork and weeks of travel, workers are asking their employers for help. They're getting it, mainly from companies in competitive industries hungry to attract and keep talent. Google, JPMorgan Chase, Abbott Laboratories, Avon and Motorola have all added adoption assistance to their buffet of benefits. In 1990, only 12% of 1,000 companies surveyed by Hewitt Associates offered financial assistance for adoption. By 2006, 45% of companies did. Rita Sorensen, executive director of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, estimates that in 2007 fully half of employers provide adoption benefits and that within five years those offerings will be considered standard.



Of companies that provide adoption assistance, it found that $4,700 is offered on average per adoption and about double that if a child has special needs or is from foster care. Companies are also giving workers an average of five weeks of paid parental leave.
