Libby and Jasmine composed piano music on the computer.  Libby really likes working on the songs, Jasmine, not so much.  Libby learned the life-lesson about computers and *saving your work*.   She didn't save for a few days (I wasn't done Daddy!), and then lost all her work when the power went off.  After some crying, she got back to work and finished the left hand.

They used the iMac to compose the music, and the iPad to play it.  Now they have to learn to play their songs on the piano for real.

Libby wrote "The Bumpy Carriage Ride" and Jasmine wrote "The Dancing Puppy."
