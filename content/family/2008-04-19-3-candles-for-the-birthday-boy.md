Dad took this picture in 1959, so I suppose 3 years old is John, or is it Steve?  Mom, who is it?

I suppose this is the picture right after it on the roll, 

  

 

  

John (3 years), Steve (19 months), Tim( 2 months), Mike (cousin Mike?) 10 months, [Carol](/blog/2006/12/04/carol-anne-eick-july-9-1955-november-27-2006/) (4 years old).  This picture was also taken in 1959.
