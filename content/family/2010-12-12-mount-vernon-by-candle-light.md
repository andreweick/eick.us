Libby's favorite place to go is Mount Vernon, so we took her there for the "Christmas by Candle light". Â They give you a tour of the George Washington's mansion and tell stories about what Christmas would have been like back then....I couldn't take any pictures of the tour (it was to dark!), but I took a few in the waiting area.
