The Tablet PC is such a natural for kids.  When [Jasmine](http://andyeick.com/gallery.aspx?tag=Jasmine) or [Libby](http://andyeick.com/gallery.aspx?tag=Libby) find my mouse, they just want to play catch with it, but when they see my tablet (“Daddy’s Baby ‘putter”, my beloved tc1100 — thanks for the tip [Dax](www.nukeation.net)!), they want to draw with the stylus.
