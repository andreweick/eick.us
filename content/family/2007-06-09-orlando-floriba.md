[![Libby trying the baby pool for the first time.](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/528186417_e88ac4408b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/528186417/ "Photo Sharing")

 

Libby getting into the "Baby pool" the first time!

 

Libby couldn't say Florida, and she thought that Florida consisted of the [Marriott hotel](http://www.marriottworldcenter.com/).  We took them over to Coco beach to see the ocean, and the whole time Libby kept saying "Be done, be done, back to floriba, i want back to floriba and go in baby pool!"

 

 

 

Libby was in heaven, in that she could eat all the [junk food](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/528091152/) she wanted "Libby, you have to finish your sugar cereal before you have your donut!"  They were able to go swimming as many times a day as they wanted, and then would be happy eating junk food.

Jasmine liked the big girl pool.  She learned to swim by herself underwater, and could sit on the bottom and wave.

Of course, now every time I leave on "the airplane to go to work" Libby is convinced I'm going to floriba, and asks if she can come to.
