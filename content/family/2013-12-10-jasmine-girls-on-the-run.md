Jasmine did the [Girls on the Run][gotr] 5K again this year -- she really likes running.

This year her 5K time was 28:23, which made her 25th out of 2,153 people, and 19th out of 2,031 girls.  She said she would have run faster, she ran 24-ish minutes in practice, but she had to stop while her running buddy tied her shoes --
