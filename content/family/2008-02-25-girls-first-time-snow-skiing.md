<div class="csharpcode">We took the girls snow skiing last weekend in Northern Michigan.  Jasmine was **SO **excited, she could hardly stand it.  Libby was excited also, but I don&#039;t think she understood that snow skiing meant you had to be outside, in the snow (she doesn&#039;t really care for snow).  Of course, when we finally got them into their skis and to the ski school, Jasmine did not look happy -- I don&#039;t think that frown ever left her face!  Libby went down the hill once, and then just wanted to ski with her family (Mom, Dad, sister, imaginary brother).   After her one time down the hill, she cried so much the instructor took her inside to color.  Jasmine did much better, up and down a few times with the teacher.  They both liked the chair lift ("I flying, Daddy"), and didn&#039;t fall that often.  Mostly they liked the swimming pool in the hotel, although it was much to cold to swim (even indoor, it wasn&#039;t heated very warm).</div><http://www.flickr.com/photos/19429588@N00/2280223557/><div class="csharpcode">[![Jasmine takes skiing lessons.
