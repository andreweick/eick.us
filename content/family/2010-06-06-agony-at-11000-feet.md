<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'">From Chris: </span>{% blockquote %}<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande'">We just completed a short vacation to the White Mountains in eastern AZ.  The altitude here ranges from 8000 - 11000 ft with our hotel at 9100 ft.  It was a great change from Phoenix with temps below freezing in the morning and low 70s during the day.  We had a wet winter so there is water everywhere and the wildlife were also everywhere.</span>Here's a few pictures.  Herd of Elk, Black River, wild horses, Booda likes the river, a big Bull Elk that came out every night in the same spot, the Jeep keeps on going!﻿﻿{% endblockquote %}
