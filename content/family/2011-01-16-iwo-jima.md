My favorite monument in D.C. is Iwo Jima and Arlington National Cemetery.  It's really hard to take a bad picture of the Iwo Jima (although I came pretty close this time).  Agony was in town for the week to fill out his standard forms and sit outside of conference rooms, so on the way back to the airport we stopped in Arlington.  The girls had so much fun with Agony!
