Jasmine went to two football games this year.  The first game of the year she lasted only 1 quarter, but it was really hot in the stands.  The second game was perfect football weather, and she lasted 2 quarters and the halftime, I think she liked the marching band. </Users/aeick/AppData/Roaming/Windows%20Live%20Writer/PostSupportingFiles/92d958ff-01fd-4568-b0df-abb23c41be76/SCAN02276.jpg>

Jasmine is starting to use colors now.  It's changing from just scribbles to shapes.  I thought this was a bought, but it was a doggy...

She can draw these faces all day long -- when we went to the MSU game, she "did her paperwork" and drew faces for everyone who sat around her..
