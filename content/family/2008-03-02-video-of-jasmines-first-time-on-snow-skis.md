Here is a video of Jasmine's skiing down the hill.  She did so well for her first time!  It's amazing the balance they have.  This was taken the first day.  The second day she went, she wasn't as adventurous -- she wanted me to hold her as she slid down the hill -- of course the second days she kept going and going and going even through the rain/ice storm!
