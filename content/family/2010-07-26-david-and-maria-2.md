Maria, David, Jimmy, and "Grandma Soupy" came to visit the girls.  They had fun seeing Washington D.C.  Denise took them downtown a few times, and we went to the Iwo Jima memorial (my favorite -- you just cannot take a bad picture of the memorial).I think the girls liked Mount Vernon the best. -- Libby still wears the bonnet she bought at the gift shop.
