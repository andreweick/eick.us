Finally got the pictures from my [IEEE conference](http://blog-family.andyeick.com/2007/03/10/2007+IEEE+Aerospace+Conference.aspx) posted.  Since I took my own ski equipment all the way out to Montana, I didn't take my real camera out there, and just bought a disposable camera -- the pictures really didn't turn out well, but the mountains were pretty.
