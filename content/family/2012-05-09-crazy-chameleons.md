Crazy Chameleons
This weekends game was much warmer, in fact hot, but the hometown heroes were short handed, they didn't even have enough girls for a full line up.  So not only did they have to play short handed the whole game, there was no substitutions for them to rest during!  Jasmine was pretty worn out the whole weekend after the game

All the Emerald Dragons are at the [team site](http://eick.us/emerald-dragons), with a direct link to all the pictures from the [May 5th game](http://eick.us/emerald-dragons/#/14/0).  For the team site I try to take picture of all the girls, not just Jasmine. If you want to be notified by email when I post a new game [sign up](http://eepurl.com/lhf_9)
