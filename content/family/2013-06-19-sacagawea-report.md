## Early life.
Sacagawea was born on 1789 or 1790. we do not know the the exact date of her birth. She was born in present day Idaho. She was a Shoshone indian.Sacagawea meant “Bird Women.”She had an older brother named Cameahwait (Ka Me ah wait).She also had a brother and sister. The Shoshone did not have schools, so Sacagawea learned from the other women in her tribe how to make  moccasins, clothing, and tipis. She also learned to make medicines from plants. The elders of the tribe taught Sacagawea the beliefs of her people. Like all Shoshone girls, Sacagawea was promised to an older man. She would become a wife at age 13 or 14. When Sacagawea was 10 or 11, a tribe called the Minnetaree attacked. 15 of the Shoshone people died in this attack because the Minnetaree had guns. While Sacagawea was running across a river, a Minnetaree warrior grabbed her and took her prisoner. Sacagawea was taken 600 miles to a Minnetaree village. She was given to a Minnetaree family. A fur trader from Canada named Toussaint Charbonneau (TOO sant Shar buh NO) came to the village where Sacagawea was staying at. She was traded for his wife. When she was 15, she was expecting a child.

## Middle Life
When Meriwether Lewis and William Clark came to where Sacagawea and her husband were living, Carbonneau took his wife to greet them.Carbonneau told the two captians that Sacagawea could speak the Shoshonee. That was VERY helpful to Lewis and Clark because the Shoshonee Indians were famous for their horse breeding. Carbonneau wanted to tag along, so he said he could help the explores. Lewis and Clark agreed to let them come along. Sacagawea and her husband moved to Fort Mandan for the winter.They shared a cabin with Lewis, Clark, and York, Clarks slave. On Feb. 11,1805, Sacagawea was about to have her baby. To hurry the birth, she was given special powder. It was made of a rattlesnakes rattle! Sacagawea drank it with water. Ten minutes later, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Carbonneau called his baby son Jean Baptiste (Jhan ba TEEST). Clark called the new baby “Pomp”. On April 7,Sacagawea, Carbonneau, Pomp, and the other voyagers  left Fort Mandan and rowed up the Missouri River in six small canoes and pirogues. The pirogues were long, narrow rowboats with sails. While they were rowing, Sacagawea knew she was getting closer to her home where she was born in. While she would be rowing boats, sometimes Sacagawea would walk on land. While doing both of these, Pomp was always on a cradle board on his mother’s back. A cradle board is a board with lace up ties that you but a baby in. Among the expedition Sacagawea found many food for the explores. On May 14,1805, something terrible happened! While Sacagawea, Pomp, and Carbonneau were rowing in one of pirogues. Suddenly, a big guest of wind knocked the boat where Sacagawea and her family were in! Quickly, Sacagawea noticed the supplies floating away. She quickly swam and saved the supplies! If it weren’t for Sacagawea, the expedition would have turned back.

## Later Life
On June 1, Sacagawea ran a high fever.As the fever grew worse, The two captians Thought she would die. They gave her tea made of tree bark and fresh water from springs. Not intil June 24 did she feel better. On June 29, was the day the worst storm struck them. Sacagawea, carring Pomp, was walking along a dry creek. As the rain began to fall, the group hid under a rock. The rain suddenly turned into a downpour!  The downpour was flooding the the empty creek. Sacagawea, Clark, and Pomp escaped. The water was almost 15 feet high.In late July, Sacagawea relised she was getting closer to the place where she was born! On Aug. 1,the explores split up to search for Sacagawea tribe. Sacagawea, Clark, and other men went searching in one direction while Lewis and other men went in another direction. On Aug.13,1805, Lewis and his three men sppoted two Shoshonee women and one Shoshonee girl. The three Shoshonee Indians agreed to take Lewis and his men to their village. Meanwhile, Clark approached with the main group. Sacagawea began dancing  with joy and began sucking on her fingers. This meant, “ These are my people.” They walked into the village. Sacagawea had barely started to translate when the cheif came it out. It was one of her brothers! While Sacagawea was translating, the captians made an agreement with the cheif;the Shoshonee would give Lewis and Clark horses for battle supplis. In late Aug., the expedition started climbing  up the Bitterroots(mountains near modern day Idaho and Montana). The Bitterroots were  hard to climb and food was scarce. Still, the group made it and saw the Pacific Ocean. They had done it!The explores started their long journey back. When they reached Saint Louis, they were heores. Sacagawea died on Dec.20,1812.

* She almost died durning the expedition
