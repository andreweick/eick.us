Carol's birthday came and went on Monday (July 9th).  I still IM her to tell her how things are going.  When I switched mobile phones the other day, I lost her voice mail she sent me a few days before she died.  Ironically, she was right -- we had a bet going on which way a business deal would go.  

 

 

 

The message ended with: "Call me when you get this."  I didn't and now I can't.
