A few weeks before Christmas we went to the [Traverse City Great Wolf Lodge](http://www.greatwolflodge.com/Locations/Traverse/).  The hotel had all the Christmas decorations up, and the girls liked to run around in the lobby.  They of course liked the water park also, with the baby pools and baby slides.  Towards the end, Jasmine was brave enough to ride on the big slides, but only once or twice....
