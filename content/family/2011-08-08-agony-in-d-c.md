I am so far behind in updating the site -- I still have pictures from our vacation I haven't posted yet.  Agony was in town again last weekend, so I figured that while I was thinking of it, I'll post a picture from the last time he visited (a few months ago)... Libby took this picture of Agony when they went swimming....
