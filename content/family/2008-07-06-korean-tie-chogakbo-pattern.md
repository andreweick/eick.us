**Chogakbo Pattern**

 {% blockquote %} 

In the period of the Yi Dynasty, our ancestors saved tens and hundreds scraps of cloth left over and quilted them together to create wrapping clothes or covers called CHOGAKBO.  Now we take the unique shape and outstanding beauty of CHOGAKBO and applied them to modern style, creating scarf, necktie, and other miscellaneous goods.

I just returned from a business trip to Korea, but I didn't have time to visit [Mr. Bo](http://blog.andyeick.com/post/2007/07/Korean-tailor-make-Mr-Andy-look-GQ.aspx) and get a new suit (only a week trip).  I did have time to do some shopping in Seoul in Itaewon.  Had a great time wandering around buying trinkets for the girls, and I picked myself up a Chogakbo patterned tie.  The tie is made up of thousands of patches of silk sewn together.  I've no idea where I bought the tie (I should have taken a picture of the shop) but hope I can find the shop and buy another when I get back to Seoul....
