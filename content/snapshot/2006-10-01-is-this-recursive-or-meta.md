At the risk of further alienating my readers ([Dax](http://nukeation.net/), really, I'm migrating family content to a family blog!).  Here's a blog post that refers to sites that linked to Steve's blog post.  Very meta.  [Google juice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_juice), nonetheless...

In what is slowly snowballing into the Trial of the Century (and being only 2006, we can safely say the Trial of the Millennium), the [dispute](http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/23/14-year-old-girl-sues-friend-over-missing-ipod/) between the families of Shannon Derrick and Stephanie Eick over a stolen iPod will not, unfortunately, be resolved in the hallowed halls of [Judge Judy's](http://www.engadget.com/2006/09/21/girls-missing-ipod-case-headed-for-judge-judy/) tough-but-fair courtroom. Amusingly, the plaintiff's mother originally saw the show as a quick way to resolve the matter on a level playing field, even though this whole incident could have been put to bed weeks ago had said mother not [rejected a free iPod](http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/31/mom-rejects-donated-ipod-proceeding-with-lawsuit/4) and associated swag donated by an anonymous do-gooder. As much as we'd love to hear JJ's take on this silly matter, since Eick's parents have been dropped from the suit and now only the piggybank of 14-year-old Stephanie is being pursued, it's up to her to approve a change of venue from Illinois to California.

Web Site Run By Uncle: Family Declines Show  



While a spokesman for the Judge Judy show would not offer any official comment Thursday, the Web site AndyEick.com announced that the Eick family had declined to appear on the nationally syndicated television show.  



"I want to confirm we have been in discussions with the Judge Judy Reality TV show and decided to pass," reads the site, hosted by an uncle of Stephanie Eick, one of the girls involved in the iPod dispute.

 ##### Family Sued Over iPod Loss Reportedly Declines To Appear

 (Naperville Sun) NAPERVILLE, Ill. A trip to California to let Judge Judith Sheindlin rule on the case of a missing iPod no longer appears to be in the cards for two local high-schoolers. While a spokesman for the "Judge Judy" show would not offer any official comment Thursday, on the Web site AndyEick.com, hosted by the uncle of 14-year-old Stephanie Eick, her father, Stephen, announced that the Eick family had declined to appear on the nationally syndicated show.
