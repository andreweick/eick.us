![thincSoft logo](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/2100790462_78f9d70aea_m.jpg)Jim Kowalski, Chief Operating Officer for thincSoft, is the featured interview on [b-eye-network](http://www.b-eye-network.com/home/).  Jim Kowalski describes thincView, a Web 2.0 solution that merges geographic data with business intelligence information in a visually intuitive tool for better decision making.

  {% blockquote %}   

Many studies indicate that over 80% of data maintained by corporations has a location component.   Historically, companies wishing to use geographic information systems (GIS) to conduct any sort of location-based analysis were hampered by their complexity of use, expense to deploy, or static nature. Therefore, location analysis was limited to certain industries or companies with large IT staffs or groups of geospatial analysts. 

    

thincVIew changes all of that. This unique solution integrates both visual data (maps, floor diagrams, CAD drawings, etc.) and business data to create a dynamic, interactive business intelligence solution.  

    

Several years ago, AMR Research coined the term "Applistructure" to designate that technology infrastructure and platforms were becoming more like applications in terms of the business value delivered to customers and their ease of use. 

    

Today, we see that value in the promise of service oriented architecture (SOA) - a technology framework that gives business users an easy way to integrate data from disparate sources and turn that into actionable information without costly or lengthy IT projects.
