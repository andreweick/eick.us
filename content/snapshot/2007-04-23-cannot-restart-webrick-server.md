![](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/468613851_77c070121e_m.jpg) Although this is now totally obvious, I thought Iâd point it out because it took me a minute to debug it today  An error in the environment.rb file will manifest itself in the server not being able to start. If you canât get your WEBrick to restart, check the environment.rbâ¦   My goodness how I miss a good compiler.
