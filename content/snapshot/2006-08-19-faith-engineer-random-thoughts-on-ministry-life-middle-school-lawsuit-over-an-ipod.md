More blog postings on my nieces lawsuit...

{% blockquote %}

It's been all over the tech news about a middle school girl who had her [ipod stolen ](http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/sunpub/naper/news/6_1_NA16_IPOD_S10816.htm)while at school. The parents are suing her friend who had borrowed it. The new American way, if anything happens bad, then sue. Don't you think this is the type of thing that could be worked out between two friends. What do you think? Should it have gone to court? BTW, a top of the line new 4Gig Nano is only $249.
