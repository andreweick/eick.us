![](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/1681285313_8d5c17b4e6.jpg)Mr. Bo's G.Q tailor make Mr. Andy more look G.Q!  Last time I was TDY, [I picked up](/2007/07/14/Korean+Tailor+Make+Mr+Andy+Look+GQ.aspx) a tailored sport coat and suit from Mr. Bo.   When you walk out of the main gate, the streets are littered with custom tailors who will sew anything (from Jerseys to stuffed animals to business suits) but my friends who live in South Korea told me that Mr. Bo was the best.  This time I picked an upgraded fabric, and was able to give Mr. Bo better directions on how to cut the sports coats.  He demonstrated the quality of the fabric by pulling out his lighter and holding the flame to the material.  He kept saying "pure silk" but I didn't know why the lighter showed that.  I said back "and flame retardant.  I'll take that and the brown one."



He was a bit rushed this time though -- I didn't get in to his shop until the second week of our trip, and so I think he rushed one of the jackets (all the threads weren't clipped off, and a few of the cuffs weren't completed) -- but no matter, the fit is still perfect and he did a much better job on the collar this time.



He did another outstanding job, once you have a fit jacket, I couldn't imagine buying off the rack again.  To get there, just walk straight out Osan AFB's gate, and his shop is on the right hand side before the first side street.  Highly recommended if you want to get a custom tailored suit while in South Korea.
