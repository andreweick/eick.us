![revolUXions](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/388628564_ec67e676cc_m.jpg)Oliver sent in a great show suggestion.  He’d like to see 

{% blockquote %}

a Datagrid-Like control (ListBox with GridView embedded). Where Sorting, Grouping, etc. is possible. On top of that it would be nice to see how styling of this thing would work out in Blend 

{% endblockquote %}

Thanks for the great suggestion, we’ll work it into a future show!
