This makes me so sad to see this kind of thing.  To think that a few months ago, a few of my work buddies took a walk down to see the Gate one night.  It really was odd, in that you could walk right up to the gate, at 11pm at night.  It was more an open park, no fences or anything.  Just a giant traffic circle around the outside, and a few tourists.  I took a few good pictures (I wasn't carrying my camera, so while they went 'juicy', I walked back to get my camera and a few pictures.)  That was the end of our trip (I was going home that day) and we had just came over from Pyongtaek-City --- 50 some miles, but 3-4 hours in Asian traffic.   I really didn't want to go out and see anything, but now I am glad I did.

SEOUL, [South Korea](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/southkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo) — The destruction in a fire of the 600-year-old southern gate to what was once the walled city of Seoul, a landmark that survived foreign invasions and wars to be designated South Korea’s top national treasure, has shocked the nation.

A 69-year-old man suspected of setting the fire was arrested Monday night on Kanghwa Island, west of Seoul, The Associated Press reported the police as saying. The man was identified only by his family name, Chae.
