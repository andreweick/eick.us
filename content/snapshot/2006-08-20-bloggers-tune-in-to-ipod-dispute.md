Stephanie made Front Page, Above The Fold!  I have to agree with the article, it is amazing how fast this turned into an international incident.  I was monitoring the blog activity and there has been sites in the U.K. and France that have picked up the story.  When I do a blog search I get several pages of hits.  Stephanie will have more Google hits than I do soon!

Naperville resident Stephen Eick, Stephanie's dad, said he is sorry for the loss, but Stephanie did not steal the iPod, and she is not responsible.  



Both sides are due in court on Monday.  



In the meantime, bloggers across the United States have picked up on the story and are weighing in on the issue. McCarthy said a friend vacationing in Louisiana and a niece in Florida both called her to say they heard about it on the news.  



"It's unbelievable," said McCarthy who was surprised the news had traveled so far so quickly. She filed the lawsuit on Aug. 4.  



Bloggers on iLounge logged 47 responses to the article about the Eicks and McCarthy.
