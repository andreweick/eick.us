[![](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/481294341_40ee0c7950_o.png) Dax](http://www.microsoft.com/Expression/products/overview.aspx?key=blend) and I have been talking on [revolUXions](http://www.revolUXions.com) about the magic of WPF/E Silverlight for awhile now.  The [recent announcements](http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=304508) have really made my head spin.  Dax and I needed time to digest all the information before we recorded the next show!



What holds the most promise for me is the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR).  [We've](http://www.sss-research.com/) been experiencing a ton of scalability problems with our JavaScript framework (once the visualizations gets thousands of data points), so the promise of 1000x increase in performance using C# over JavaScript is enticing.  Expect to see some benchmarks from me, because this is certainly a pain point for us.



I've been doing a bit of [Ruby](http://blog.andyeick.com/CategoryView,category,Ruby.aspx) work lately.  Everyone should lean a new language every so often (and no, learning VB.Net after you've programmed C# doesn't count).  At first I was lovin' me some [rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/), but I've since grown enamored with the language itself.  I love the [DRY principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (don't repeat yourself), the convention of only declaring and defining things once, and I both love and hate [duck typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) (I love it when it works, I hate it when it doesn't).  



The thing I hate the most, though, is the lack of a real IDE, and the lack of a compiler.  These problems will both be solved by the integration of Dynamic languages in Silverlight.  I can't wait to try [IronRuby](http://www.iunknown.com/2007/04/introducing_iro.html)!



 



Below is [a diagram](http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/e/f2ecc2ad-c498-4538-8a2c-15eb157c00a7/SL_Map_FinalNET.png) I found that gives an overview of the platform vision.
