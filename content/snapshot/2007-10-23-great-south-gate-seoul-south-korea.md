Just returned from another 2 weeks in South Korea.  Busy trip with most of my time spent inside the office!  I did find a great gym located on Osan Air force base -- a short 20 minute walk from the hotel I stayed at right in front of the main gate.  Even after 3 trips over there, I still haven't been on a DMZ tour, or, for that matter, spent more than a few hours in Seoul!



We (Steve and I) did try to cut out early on Friday, to get a few hours in Seoul before leaving Saturday morning back to the states, but after a 5 hour cab ride in South Korea Traffic, we didn't arrive in the city until almost 2100!  We had a drink, and took a walk around the hotel.  We were 5 blocks from ì­ë¡ë¬¸ (Namdaemun,  Great Southern Gate)

This is Korea's National Treasure Number 1, constructed in 1396 and was finished in 1398.  It marked the entrance into the city but was partially destroyed by the Japanese during the colonial period.  We also took a stroll through the market which is adjacent to the gate.  The market has been in operation since roughly 1400, and had stalls and vendors which sold everything -- From knockoff coach bags (Steve couldn't find a good deal) to pig's heads (neither of us were hungry), it was for sale...

Went for traditional sushi one of the nights and it was not only good, the plates were so pretty!  I almost hated to eat the fish, well, almost...
