[Phil Factor](http://www.simple-talk.com/author/phil-factor/) had a great post where he spins the creation of the world as an IT project   "Art thou sure of meeting the aggressive six-day schedule for this project, verily??"  The smartly-clad angels looked nervously around for a spokesman. After a moment, a well-groomed executive angel stepped forward.  "We have, er...hath..., a total commitment to quality delivery of an effective solution"  "...meaning?"  "Our mission is to achieve total excellence in meeting the timescales for delivery of the project to the defined and agreed scope".  "Quality...excellence...", harmonised the assembled IT angels, upon hearing this confirmation of their mission statement, and rustled their feathered-wings to signal their commitment and solidarity.  "..and we're all clear on the project deliverables?" asked God. "Being more of the instinctive sort of executive, I realise I may have been heavy on the overall project vision...you know 'let there be light', and that sort of stuff...and light on the practicalities. I'm not really a detail person. That's why I delegate that sort of thing to you. I can appreciate that this is really a logistics and facilities-management issue but, we're 5 days in to a 6-day project and exploding two-headed donkeys at this stage make me rather nervous."
