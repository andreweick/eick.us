I'm with Kevin on this one (majorly annoyed bordering on perturbed).  It's hard for me to think of Vista as even new, much less not supported.  I switched to [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/) on December 30, it never even crossed my mind that they **wouldn't** have a free upgrade to a Vista compatible version.  I won't upgrade to Vista until VMWare sorts it out, virtual machines are that important to a developers workflow.  

 

Possibly VMWare thought that Microsoft was kidding, and they really weren't going to release Vista?

Am I the only one majorly annoyed by VMWare's support policy (or lack there-of) for VMWare on a Vista host? Apparently EMC's stance is that in order to run VMWare on a Vista host, we need to wait for VMWare 6.0. This presents several problems:  

 - VMWare 6.0 is only in it's first beta. VMWare major release cycles are not typically short. They're usually a least a couple betas and one or two release candidates. That means we'll be waiting a while.  

- Major VMWare upgrades usually cost. 

 

I've been a big fan of VMWare for a long time. It's a much more capable virtualization product than Virtual PC. I'd much rather use VMWare, even if it costs money and VPC is free. But they're not giving me a lot of outs here.
