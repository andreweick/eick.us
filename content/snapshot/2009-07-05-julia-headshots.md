Headshots I took for Julia that she needed for a Piano competition.  I think I just saw on her facebook page that she got accepted to play.  (I'm sure these photographs contributed in some small way...)[![Julia headshot brown](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/3557469113_3f17ecafe4.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/19429588@N00/3557469113 "View 'Julia headshot brown' on Flickr.com")[![Julia headshot green](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/3558283422_fffe6ef8be.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/19429588@N00/3558283422 "View 'Julia headshot green' on Flickr.com")I think she went with the green one, but I like the composition of the brown one better...
