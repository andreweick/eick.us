More from the trial -- apparently it was a zoo at the courthouse with T.V. crews and newspaper reporters.  Steve said he was interviewed by 3 different TV stations and 1/2 dozen newspapers.  The picture is of Steve and his attorney.  Next court date is Sept. 21.  

 

I'm proud of Stephanie's comments, she is showing a maturity you don't often see in 14 year olds!

#### iPod case tossed out of court on technicality 

 

August 22, 2006

The brief showdown resulted in the dismissal of a complaint by Melanie McCarthy, the mother of Shannon Derrik, 14, the owner of the missing music player.  



McCarthy is suing Stephanie Eick, also 14, for $475, after Stephanie borrowed Shannon's new iPod and, while Shannon was in the restroom, set it on Shannon's desk. That was on their last day of middle school in June. The iPod, which Shannon said she had saved for while working part-time and baby-sitting, was missing when she returned

 

DuPage Circuit Court Judge Dorothy French dismissed the complaint on a request by the defendant because of a technical issue: It did not say who is responsible for the lost iPod or why.
