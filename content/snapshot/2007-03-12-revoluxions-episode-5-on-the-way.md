[![revolUXions](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/388628564_ec67e676cc_m.jpg)](http://www.revoluxions.com/)Dax and I are hard at work on the next [revolUXions](http://www.revoluxions.com/).  We haven’t recorded the episode yet, but I’m really looking forward to it.  Being a developer, I’m always worried about trying to integrate the design and the application at the last minute.  I’ve been on many projects where the last weekend was spent trying to cut and paste the designers graphics into the site, only to have the site look hickly-pickly.  For the first several episodes we’ve spent exploring the [Blend](http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/expression-blend/default.mspx), but to me it really doesn’t matter how good it looks until we try to integrate the graphic look and feel into the final application.  In this episode [Dax](www.nukeation.net) is going to design some dark tone-on-tone reflective buttons in [Blend](http://www.microsoft.com/products/expression/en/expression-blend/default.mspx), hand them off to me as a DLL, and I’m going to integrate them into my Visual Studio 2005 project to create an application.  Isn’t this the promise, that Designers can Design, and Developers can Develop, each in their own environment?
