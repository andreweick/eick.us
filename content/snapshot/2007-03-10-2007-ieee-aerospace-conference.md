Just returned from the [2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference](http://www.aeroconf.org/) in [Big Sky](http://www.bigskyresort.com/) Montana.  I was presenting [my paper on AJAX, SVG and geospatial situational awareness](http://blog.andyeick.com/2007/01/09/GeoBoosttrade+An+AJAX+Web+20+Collaborative+Geospatial+Visualization+Framework.aspx).  My talk was well received and there was good feedback.

 

The conference was good, I learned a bunch of [new things](http://www.aeroconf.org/2007_web/2007%20IEEE%20Aerospace%20Conference%20Papers%20with%20Presenter%20and%20Title.htm) and tried to network.  Networking was pretty hard, in that everyone else was really a rocket scientist.

 

The conference was at Big Sky ski resort in Bozeman Montana, a really long ways away and a day long trip in airports in rental car lines to get there.  I went skiing a few of the days and even went up to the top to ski down.  The top was so high up, you could see this little itty bitty tiny shack on the tip top of the mountain.  The only way down is on the side.

I had to take 3 chairlifts, and a tiny gondola to get to the top.  The whole way up I kept looking up (it was a straight up) "I can do this, I can do this, I can do this."  Once I got to the top, stepped off the tram and looked around, I wasn't so sure!  The edge just disappeared under your feet (they told me later it's a 45 degree angle at the top, and I don't ski that often).  It was actually breathtaking, the view was fantastic, and the snow just fell away.  I made it down _slowly_, only falling once.  The hill was so steep I just kept skidding down, and had to crawl up to retrieve my skis on my hands and knees.

 

I'll post the photographs after I get them downloaded from my camera....
