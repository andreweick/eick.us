I just came back from overseas so I suffered through the airlines again.  The domestic airlines certainly don't have to wonder why they are going out of business, they have themselves to blame.  As an example, Northwest didn't credit my last overseas trip to my frequent flyer account  (Which I don't understand, since I booked the trip on the Northwest website)  I just called them, waded through the voice mail maze, and after twenty minutes of hold time, they gave the announcement "Due to heavy call volumes, we are disconnecting your call."  

 

Customer service matters

**Another month-end surge in cancellations riles Northwest travelers**  



Reputation suffers: As pilots, airline trade blame, carrier promises more fixes  



Northwest Airlines' pattern of cancellations continued Sunday, with more than 200 flights dropped as pilots who were pushed to the limit of hours they are allowed to fly each month stayed home from work.  



The airline blamed the pilots, who in turn blamed the airline for failing to address staff shortfalls after it canceled more than 2,000 flights in June, many of them toward the end of the month.  



Passengers suffered again Sunday, especially at Detroit Metro Airport.

Oh, and I was reading the story about how Northwest stranded all the travelers online, the inline advertisement was for Northwest -- I thought that was funny.
