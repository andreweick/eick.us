I've been looking all over for this, but have just found it.  What I wanted was an RSS feed that just put out the final scores from sporting events.  There's a billion "sports feeds" sites on the net, some even allow you to personalize the feed to your favorite teams, but they are to noisy with to many spurious items.  If you just want a feed that lets you know the final score of the game, this is the feed. 

  

 

  

[Detroit Lions](http://www.totallyscored.com/rss/team/171), [Michigan State football](http://www.totallyscored.com/rss/team/270), [Detroit Tigers](http://www.totallyscored.com/rss/team/73)

  {% blockquote %}   

Totally Scored exists to make it easy to track your favorite sports or teams using any [RSS reader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator) by subscribing to the feed. You can customize the display so that you only see the results you are interested in. Whenever a game ends, the final score will be automatically downloaded to your computer, cellphone, or other RSS reader. Never miss out on a winning game! Of course you are not required to use [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29) - feel free to bookmark the site with your browser and check back whenever it is convenient for you.
