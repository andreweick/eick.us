Isn't wikipedia great?  I took this picture over in Korea at an open air market outside of Osan.  I had no idea what it was, but there were big bowls sitting out for sale.  I noticed the picture was posted to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tteok), and the food is Kkul tteok (꿀떡), a Korean dessert made with honey -- I should have tried it![![Market outside of Osan, Korea](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/512128274_0349caffdd.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/512128274/ "Market outside of Osan, Korea by AndrewEick, on Flickr")

Probably because the kkul tteok was on the same plate as squid, I had lost my appetite...[![Dinner, Osan, Korea](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/512176049_8ff7c3d50b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/512176049/ "Dinner, Osan, Korea by AndrewEick, on Flickr")My favorite picture from the trip, though, was taken on the streets of Anjung-Ri[![Market Day -- Spices on the streets of Anjung-Ri, Korea](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/512156955_ac0ca56f82.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/512156955/ "Market Day -- Spices on the streets of Anjung-Ri, Korea by AndrewEick, on Flickr")[Click here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/tags/korea/show/) to see a slide show of all my Korea pictures
