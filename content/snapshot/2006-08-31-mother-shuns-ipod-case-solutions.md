Plaintiff refuses anonymous gift, paid TV appearance

A generous benefactor has donated a new iPod Nano to the girl whose iPod was stolen, but the girl's mother is refusing the gift and pursuing her lawsuit against her daughter's 14-year-old classmate.  



The donor dropped off a package at the front desk of The Sun around 11:45 a.m. Wednesday. The colorful cardboard box decorated with a confetti design contained an iPod Nano, a pink case and $50 worth of iTunes gift certificates. The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, left a letter that the iPod was for Shannon Derrik.
