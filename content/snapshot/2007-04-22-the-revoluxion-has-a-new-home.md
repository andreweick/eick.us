[![revolUXions](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/388628564_ec67e676cc_m.jpg)](http://ux.nukeation.com)or, at least a new RSS feed home

 

[Dax](http://www.nukeation.net) has been busy!  We moved over the [revolUXions](http://www.revolUXions.com) to a real blog engine.  Unfortunately, everyone needs to update the links...

We'll have comments enabled on each show, so any feedback would be great.

 

 

 

Stay tuned to the blog, we have a bunch of new ideas for the show, as well as some [silverlight](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/asp/default.aspx) discussions
