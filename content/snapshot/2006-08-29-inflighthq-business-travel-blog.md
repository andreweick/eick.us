Now that I travel more this sure hits close to home!  I realize margins are thin for the airlines, but raise ticket prices a buck and offer free water bottles!  The other thing I don't get is carry-on's.  Hello, airlines?  The reason I try to stuff everything into the overhead bin is not because I enjoy dragging my case through security and airport gates, it's because when I land I want to get on my way in a reasonable amount of time...

{% blockquote %}### No Liquids Means Thirsty Passengers

#### [30 Aug 06](http://inflighthq.com/archives/2006/08/no_liquids_mean.htm) by Teresa Valdez Klein



[![](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/inFlightHQBusinessTravelBlog_8C2A/water%5B4%5D.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/73508025@N00/97272459) It’s no secret that the air inside an airplane cabin during flight is dryer than the Sahara. Back in the good old days before the liquids and gels ban, I’d bring on a liter of water, a tube of Burt’s Bees and enough moisturizer to make a sharpei’s skin look like Joan Rivers’.



_The New York Times_ [asked the same question](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/travel/27prac.html?ex=1314331200&en=5fe771b4d2a2af25&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) and was met with a “you’re making mountains out of molehills” response from the airlines. But I have to agree with intrepid _Times_ reporter Michelle Higgins. The airlines need to pay more attention to keeping passengers hydrated in the face of all these new restrictions.
