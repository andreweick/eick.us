Just got a Christmas card from my Korean Tailor, Mr. Bo's GQ!  I've [bought](/post/2007/10/Tailored-suit-from-Osan-AFB-South-Korea.aspx) a [handful](/post/2007/07/Korean-tailor-make-Mr-Andy-look-GQ.aspx) from him, so I'm probably a good client.  They are well made, and when I upgraded to a better fabric, I really like the jackets.  He was a bit rushed last time (Even though I told him which day I was leaving, I don't think it was done in time -- you can tell that some of the stitches aren't up to snuff...)  Nonetheless, I love the jackets, and will probably get another one when I go back -- you just can't beat a garment that is made exactly for you....

Next time you go to [Osan Air Force Base](http://maps.yahoo.com/broadband/#mvt=s&lat=37.090556&lon=127.029722&mag=6), or are in Pyongtaek-City,  stop and tell Mr. Bo I sent you...(although he still won't give me a discount).  It's right out the front gate, about 2 blocks down on the left, across from Golden Gate and The Sting.
