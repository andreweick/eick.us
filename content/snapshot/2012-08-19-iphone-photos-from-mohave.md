I've spent the last three weeks out in the Mohave desert for work -- a few snapshots from my iPhone.  

While I was out there I went to see the Giant Sequoia at the [trail of a hundred Giants](http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/sequoia/gsnm/gsnm-long-meadow-grove.html) and right outside of town is the [Trona Pinnacles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trona_Pinnacles).

I made the [collage](http://media.eick.us/2012/iPhoto-journal/Ridgecrest,%20California/Public/index.html) on the plane coming home right on my phone.
