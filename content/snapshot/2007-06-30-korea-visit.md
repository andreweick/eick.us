A while back I went to Korea (Anjung-Ri, South Korea) with [Steve](http://www.sss-research.com/about-us.aspx) to do some work.  Anjung-Ri is about 60 miles south of Seoul, but at least 2 hours by car (The traffic is terrible!).



 



While there, I bought some celadon pottery.  Celadon actually means "green", but it seems everyone uses the term to mean "pottery from South Korea."  The glaze isn't quite green, but more subdued bluish and greyish green tones.  The pieces are very delicate, and if you look close enough you can see cracks visible through the glaze.  Pottery is difficult to photograph because of the reflections, but I tried to capture the shapes:

I bought a yin-yang shape, and a tea set, and surprisingly, they made it home in one piece.  I was there a few weeks, and was there for 'market day'  People lined the streets setting up stands to sell spices, fish, etc.

Something that was really fun was they took us on a helicopter tour of the area, that was my first time riding a helicopter, and the pilot really tried to "Make the computer geeks toss their cookies."  We pulled some negative gravity and 90 degree spins, but we made it out no problem.  They did tell me to duck when I was getting into the machine (not sure why)
