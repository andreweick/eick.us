![revolUXions](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/388628564_ec67e676cc_m.jpg)[Dax](http://www.nukeation.net) and I recorded episode #5 of [revolUXions](http://www.revolUXions.com) and just posted it.  I wanted to really understand the integration and workflow issues which XAML and MS-Blend is going to help us solve.  I've worked with so many designers in the past where the work product has been a Photoshop-file.  On past projects, a few weeks before ship, I get a photoshop file containing the look and feel of the product.  Not anymore -- as we show in this episode, the designer (working in MS Blend) hands off a DLL file which encapsulates the look and feel of the app, while the developer (working in VisualStudio) just 'add a reference' to the new DLL, and all the interface components change  to the new look.
