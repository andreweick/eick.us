"The typical Chinese roof probably dates from c 1500 BC, but it is known only from the Han dynasty (202 BC - AD 200). Graceful, overhanging, sometimes in tiers, with upturned eaves. Roof tiles were colorfully glazed and painted."

  

 

  

My camera isn't this bad -- I'm telling everyone that China really is over saturated in color (or the rain made the colors bright).  Amazing to look at the sky, it was just 'white-out' from pollution.  The pollution when I was there was over powering, tough to even walk out side without my eyes watering.
