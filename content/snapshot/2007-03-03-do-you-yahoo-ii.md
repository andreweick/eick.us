They used one of my images on the front page of Yahoo answers [again](http://blog-family.andyeick.com/2007/02/23/Do+You+Yahoo.aspx)— this time my photo of [a Lunar Eclipse](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/175246253/).  It was from a few years ago, during the summer I think.  I remember setting up the tripod, and then leaving for 3–5 minute exposures…
