[![revolUXions](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/388628564_ec67e676cc_m.jpg)](http://ux.nukeation.com)As [Dax](http://www.nukeation.net) and I have been saying over on [revolUXions](http://www.revolUXions.com), MS has listened to the feedback and will be releasing Expressions as part of the MSDN network.  I'm not surprised at all -- in the last few years MS has really turned into a company that listens to the community well ([Team System pricing](http://www.larkware.com/editorials/vs2005.html), etc).

 

Kudo's, though, for listening!
