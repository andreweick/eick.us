[![](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/friendshugging.jpg)](http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=technologyNews&storyID=2006-09-03T171037Z_01_T327763_RTRUKOC_0_US-APPLE-CHINA.xml&archived=False)After folding under public (and perhaps governmental) pressure and [reducing the damages it was seeking](http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/31/foxconn-folds-under-pressure-drastically-declaws-lawsuit/) against two Chinese journalists from 30 million yuan ($3.77 million) to just 1 yuan (12 cents), Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry has now wised up and dropped the libel suit altogether. 







In an encouraging sign that this method of dispute settlement may actually be gaining ground elsewhere in the world, TiVo followed the announcement by sending a bouquet of flowers to Echostar, NTP decided to return the [$612 million it won](http://www.engadget.com/2006/03/03/rim-ntp-settle-for-612-million-finally/) from RIM inside a Hallmark greeting card, and Shannon Derrik and Stephanie Eick (the [iPod lawsuit girls](http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/23/14-year-old-girl-sues-friend-over-missing-ipod/)) realized after a mediated tea party that they wanted to forgo the [legal silliness](http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/31/mom-rejects-donated-ipod-proceeding-with-lawsuit/) and go back to being BFFs.
