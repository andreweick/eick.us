A picture I took in the U.P. was used to illustrate Professor Amy Harris's meditation on shapes in geological formations...Â 

{% blockquote %}A personal description and a private geometry, I might add, although apparently [![](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/sediment.jpg)](http://bp0.blogger.com/_YkXfmLufVmw/RaDx4rr81BI/AAAAAAAAAAk/q1ldGr0-0HI/s1600-h/sediment.jpg)research has found patterns in even this kind of conceptual [synaesthesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia), reporting that chronologies tend to be linear or otherwise coherently organized. A prosaic description, perhaps, of the cognitive tricks we all employ to orient, understand, and remember. But synaesthetic mappings occur beyond the level of metaphor or cognitive convenience: they are essentially eidetic because they are automatic and extended. And, perhaps not unlike like Blake's wheel or Yeats' gyre, my map of time flows outward and upward. But its recursions are not spiral; they are limnological, like sediment layers under a still lake, or like geological formations laid down across epochs. And, in the same way that a paleontologist might survey a stony landscape seeking evidence of the organic past, it is possible to read these temporal landscapes looking for patterns and discontinuities across time and space.{% endblockquote %}
