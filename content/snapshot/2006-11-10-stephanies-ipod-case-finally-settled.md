The settlement had Waubonsie Valley High School freshman Stephanie Eick, of Naperville, handing over her white, 30 gigabyte video iPod that she received last Christmas to Shannon Derrick, also a freshman at Waubonsie.  



âI want to congratulate you on being able to settle this,â Associate Judge Dorothy French told the girls and their families during their brief court appearance.
