Located in New Mexico, Chaco Canyon is one of the most extensive prehistoric ruins in America. For years archaeologists have assumed that Chaco was primarily an ancient trading center. Now, this nationally broadcast film (narrated by Robert Redford and first aired on PBS,) shows that Chaco was instead a complex ceremonial center, harmonized by extraordinary astronomical alignments of buildings and roads, and elegant light and shadow markings. Aerial and time lapse footage, computer modeling, and interviews with scholars show how the Chacoan culture oriented and located its major buildings in relation to the sun and moon.
