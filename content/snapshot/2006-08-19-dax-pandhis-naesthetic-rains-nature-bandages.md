Of all the blog posts I've read over the years, this one has resonated with me the longest.  I wish all bloggers would make an entry like this, a travelogue view into their hometown.  Sure, most blogs have an "about me" link that shows where they live, maybe even a map (as if I don't know where Seattle, WA is).  But this post is more a "Come on, I want to show you where I live!"  Dax told me about his hometown (Gujarat, India) the way a local would, inviting me into his corner of the world to "show it off".   Just think if everyone had just one post about their hometown, we'd all learn a little bit about a place we might not ever get to, and be able to see it through the eyes of someone who lives there.  Isn't that what the Internet is for, taking us places we might not be able to get to?



Thanks Dax, you made the world a little smaller for me.  I hope I can return the favor!

I have always been a nature nut (or as some say, a nut by nature) and I relish any chance to hop on over to Solitude. Now, yesterday at dawn, June 26th, I was kinda stressed out, NukeBall had to be delayed (for the last time) to July 24th, and needed a break. I had been working all night (all through the rain and ten gazillion power failures) and suddenly I noticed it was freakin’ red outside. It was dawn and I hadn’t noticed.



For a very arid desert-like area, you don’t get too much visibility as there’s always sand blowing about. But the rain had cleared the air, and the red and blue sky was amazing! Like I mentioned, I love going to Solitude. It’s a small mountain range about 6 miles from where I live (See map below). Officially, the place has no name.
