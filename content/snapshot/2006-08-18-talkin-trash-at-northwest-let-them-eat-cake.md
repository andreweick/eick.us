I suppose we all could use some money saving tips with the Michigan economy being the way it is, and Northwest was just trying to help their valued associates and workers with these money saving suggestions, but I'll agree with the people who feel this is insensitive.

**Money saving Suggestions from Northwest Airlines** -- Don't be shy: Go Dumpster-diving  



â¢ Don't be shy about pulling something you like out of the trash.  



â¢ Move to a less expensive place.  



â¢ Ask your doctor for samples of prescriptions.  



â¢ Use newspapers for cat litter.  



â¢ Buy spare parts for your car at the junkyard.  



â¢ Search the Web for freebies.  



â¢ Never go to the grocery store hungry.  



â¢ Take a date for a walk.  



   



Imagine that you expect to be laid off next month, and you're fretting about how you'll make ends meet.  



Then your employer hands you a list of money-saving tips that include pulling items out of the trash and taking shorter showers.  



That's what happened at Northwest Airlines for about a week.  



Northwest has apologized for and pulled from company literature a list titled "101 Ways To Save Money," after outraged workers called some of its suggestions insulting.
