This is an idea that [Dax](http://www.nukeation.net) and I have been talking about for awhile.  The idea is to supply a set of pre-drawn themes and styles that could be used out of the box, just add a reference, and away you go.  The themes are created by a professional graphic artists, so that us developers aren't stuck with the 'gun metal gray applications.  I always wondered why there wasn't a cottage industry that sprang up to supply us ("developers") with ASP.Net Master Page / Themes that were pre-canned, pop them in and use them, but Master Page / Themes weren't as easy as this.  As Dax showed me in an revolUXions episode, adding a theme is as easy as adding a reference.

 

 

 

The cost looks pretty reasonable, and you know nukeation does quality work.  Should be a winner!
