UPDATE: [Steve's settlement comments here.](http://blog.andyeick.com/2006/11/10/The+End+Of+A+Nuisance+Lawsuit.aspx)

Iâm Stephen Eick, the father of Stephanie Eick, the 14-year old Naperville Illinois girl who is being sued over a lost iPod Nano. We had a really fun opportunity to settle the iPod dispute. The Judge Mathis TV show contacted both of us by sending us federal expresses and following up with phone calls inviting us to litigate our case on their show in front of Judge Greg Mathis on TV. This particular court TV show is filmed in Chicago (Naperville is a Chicago suburb). The deal is that the TV show agreed to send limos out to pick up both families, drive us downtown to the NBC building, where we would hash things out tomorrow. This dispute is so bizarre, 14-year olds arguing over a lost iPod, that it belongs on TV. Best of all, the TV shows pays the judgment for the loser which means that nobody looses.This show appears in the afternoon in our area on channel 26. I had not seen it before and so we recorded three or four episodes and the show and immediately agreed. [This is a good show!](http://www.askjudgemathis.com/) Judge Mathis appeared to be fair and had a great sense of humor. The cases were great and pretty funny.[![](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/AlmostsettledtheiPoddisputeonJudgeMathis_149AC/mall_thumb1.jpg)](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/AlmostsettledtheiPoddisputeonJudgeMathis_149AC/mall3.jpg) At first when we got the invitation to appear on TV, my daughter, Stephanie, said no. But when I told her that all of the participants would get $200 appearance fees, her attitude quite abruptly changed. She even asked me for âan advanceâ on her take as she has a mall trip planned. For Shannon Derrik, the girl who lost her iPod, this also would have been a good deal. With her $200, she was guaranteed money for a new iPod, win, loose, or draw. If she would win, she would of course walk away with a bunch more money. For me, I just wanted to be the first in my family to be on reality TV.What went wrong? Itâs sort of weird. The producer of the show called both me and Ms. McCarthy (Shannonâs mother) up and got us both to agree to an appearance. They wanted to slot us in tomorrow (August 31, 2006) since this case is such a hot news item. The next thing I know, the show calls me back and said that Ms. McCarthy wasnât returning phone calls.  A couple days later the producer calls me again, this time very frustrated, because Ms McCarthy wonât return his calls.  Either she wants to be on their show or not.  He says me that heâs just trying to do his job and that Ms. McCarthy should not have agreed to be on it if she didnât want to and should be polite enough to return is calls and bow out diplomatically. Finally, I got a call at the end of the day today that our case for tomorrow is off.[![](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/AlmostsettledtheiPoddisputeonJudgeMathis_149AC/limo_thumb9.jpg)](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/AlmostsettledtheiPoddisputeonJudgeMathis_149AC/limo11.jpg) Iâm bummed as I really wanted to be on the Judge Mathis TV Show. Usually you have to sign up well in advance and pay to be in the audience. I missed my opportunity to get limoed into the city and be paid to appear.  It would have been a great way to end this dispute. tags: [ipod](http://technorati.com/tag/ipod), [lawsuit](http://technorati.com/tag/lawsuit)
