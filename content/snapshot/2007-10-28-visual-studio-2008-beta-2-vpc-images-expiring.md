I just got an email alerting me to the fact that the VS2008 VPC image is going to expire on **November 1, 2007**, rather than on March 15, 2008 as originally announced.  If you are using the VPC image to test out the new VisualStudio, you need to migrate your data soon.  [We've](www.sss-research.com) been using VS2008 for a while and are very happy with it, but most of we either installed the bits on our virtual partition, or some of our risky team members installed it right on our the base O.S.

FAQ

    

Q. Will my data be available after November 1, 2007?

    

A. This is still being researched, however, currently the understanding is that customers will NOT be able to access their date after November 1st unless the data is moved to an alternate installation location.

    

Q. Can I reset my system date to re-enable the OS image?

    

A. Again there is still research being done, however, from the current understanding of the problem resetting the system date back DOES NOT re-enable the OS image.
