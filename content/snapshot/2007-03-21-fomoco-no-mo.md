[![ford name tag](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/408903535_bc90167719_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/408903535/ "Photo Sharing")Well, after almost 15 years I left the safe corporate confines behind to venture out [on my own](http://www.sss-research.com/).  Iâve done some really big systems for Ford, and the experience taught me about how to scale systems.  Iâm proud of the work I did at Ford.  I watched as we went from authoring our service manuals in AmiPro to authoring in my SGML / XML publishing engine.  I was part of the team that migrated from a windows 3.1 (medium memory model) C++ âhypertextâ viewing system into our current website which experience millions of hits a month.  Iâm proud that the system we created was put into every Ford dealership in North America and throughout Europe.With the recent downturns in the American auto market, Ford just wasnât the same place that I started with and I just didnât have the energy anymore to fight the bureaucracy of a large company.I had the above name badge on my cube wall and somebody decorated it for me.  Iâll certainly miss my friends, but they are still at the end of an email address for me.
