### <i>![](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/2100790462_78f9d70aea_m.jpg) Visual Intelligence Leverages Leading Technology Stack to Deliver Greater Value Across the Enterprise</i>

  

SEATTLE--[thincSoft](http://www.thincsoft.com/), the company that “Put Business Intelligence on the Map” today announced at the Oracle Spatial User Group expanded integration with Oracle technology products and solutions. 

  

Building on successful implementations of thincVIew integrated with Oracle database, thincSoft has expanded its integration with Oracle products and solutions to include: Oracle WebCenter, Oracle Spatial 10g, Oracle Coherence, Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition, Oracle Data Warehouse, and Oracle’s security solutions including Label Security and Identity Management. 

  

The joint thincSoft/Oracle solution is now deployed at customers in the retail industry as well as within the Department of Defense and U.S. Government sectors. 

  

“We have been very pleased with the short time and effort it has taken to integrate our solution with more and more of the Oracle stack based on customer requests. With our Web 2.0 architecture and Oracle’s commitment to industry standards and 'Hot-Pluggable' components, we are able to focus less time on integration and more time on delivering business value to our customers,” said thincSoft Chief Operating Officer Jim Kowalski. 

  

Recent market studies indicate that over 80% of data maintained by corporations has a location component. As enterprises start to harness the business value of combining Geographic Information Systems with traditional Business Intelligence data, they combat the challenge of integrating data from multiple sources. thincSoft’s thincVIew product is the first to address this growing market need of business data from multiple sources and location content from multiple vendors.
