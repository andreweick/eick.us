We did a logo for the project we are working on for work -- Most project logos are quasi military and pretty boring [boring](http://culturalknowledge.org/Data/Sites/1/site_graphics/dcgs-a_logo.png), but not ours.  Everyone remembers it. 

First time we met the PM we asked him about the rest of the team and how we fit/  He said, "I have 5 things I'm worried about, NVS, TENS, CENTAUR, FAME, and you're thing five."

The name stuck.
