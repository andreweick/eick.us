_**Don't buy WebCal from snoopsoft.com!**_



[![](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/GoogleCalendargCalandPocketPC_F04E/gcalSample_thumb2.jpg)](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/GoogleCalendargCalandPocketPC_F04E/gcalSample4.jpg) It just seems so obvious to me, what with all of these online calendars, somebody would grab the SDK, and write a PocketPC app that could download the calendar and view it off line.  I know, I know, the cool kids have EVDO or such, so there is no concept of offline, but not all of us are always on the grid yet.



 



So I found a program that would do just that!  WebCal from snoopsoft.com.  They didn't offer a free-trial, although the site promised to have one by June 23 (notice they didn't say what year, and seeing as June 23 is 2 months ago, I guess they mean next year).



 



Needless to say, I can't get the application to work.  My PocketPC is relatively clean (I have a GPS program on it), and when I load the program, I have to hard-reset the device to get it back.  I emailed the developer for help, and the message came back (a bounced message)

I'm not holding my breath for either a refund or support.



Any PocketPC developers our there -- If you write a program that downloads my gCal to my PocketPC, I'll buy it!
