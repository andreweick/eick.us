I saw this article on the op-ed page today, and it made me laugh because I've said the same thing to my GPS.  

  {% blockquote %}   

Like many men, I quickly established a romantic attachment to my G.P.S. I found comfort in her tranquil and slightly Anglophilic voice. I felt warm and safe following her thin blue line. More than once I experienced her mercy, for each of my transgressions would be greeted by nothing worse than a gentle, “Make a U-turn if possible.”

I have the Garmin Nuvi and wouldn't dream of leaving home without it.  With all the traveling I do (3-4 days a week), I can't imagine getting in a rental car and not being able to have the unit guide me.  It's a great device, but I must admit the power option is bewildering.  It comes with a non-standard plug to provide power.  Even though you can recharge it through a mini-USB plug to an outlet, the car charger requires an interface which is snapped onto the back -- anything which makes my travel bag heavier I try to avoid.  I just updated the maps to the 2008 version, so I shouldn't be getting lost for the next few years anyway!
