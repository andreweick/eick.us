A conversation I had today with my [friend](http://nukeation.net/).  Little did I know that today was [Talk Like A Pirate Day!](http://www.talklikeapirate.com/piratehome.html)  



How many times would you need to apply [DeMorgan's Theorem](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/electronic/gate.html#c1) to simulate a 0?

"Aye, laddie, when we cohded back in the dayh, we haid no stryctyrs. We just payssed 'em vayriabuls one by one."



**Gen. A. Bugbyte:**
