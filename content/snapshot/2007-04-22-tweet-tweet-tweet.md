[![P1000553](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/272099387_76224d57a8_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/37477626@N00/272099387/ "P1000553")This is how I **exactly** felt about twitter.  I thought of it as "group instant message."  Now that I've left [Ford](http://blog.andyeick.com/2007/03/21/FoMoCo+No+Mo.aspx), I no longer see those friends every day.  I thought [twitter](http://twitter.com/) would be a way to keep in touch with them all at the same time.  As it turned out, the people I tweet the most are also the people I communicate with regularly anyway.  My friend [Liam](http://blog.licasdigital.com/2007/04/the_twitter_cur.html) thinks the twitter phenomena is about connections.  I just want a way to let my friends know what city I'm in!  (Stalkers can just subscribe to my [RSS feed](http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/1166771.rss) to know where I am...)

Tony Stubblebine, who founded a social network called CrowdVine, wrote to me: âAt some point I got so busy and self-absorbed that I stopped reading or writing personal e-mails. Iâd see my sister about once a month and ask, âWhatâs up?â only to find out, âNot much.â Now I have a much more detailed picture of her life.â

btw, my twitter name is [AndrewEick](http://twitter.com/AndrewEick) for anyone who wants to join my circle of friends...

 

 

 

p.s., [Twittervision](http://twittervision.com/) is fun, but I can't help but feel the whole world is banal.  It's like "Overheard in the Planet".
