[![thincSoft logo](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/2100790462_78f9d70aea_m.jpg)](http://thincSoft.com)See thincSoft at [NRF 2008](http://events.nrf.com/annual08/public/enter.aspx). Visit booth 264 at the Javits Convention Center to learn how retailers can benefit from location intelligence. thincSoft will illustrate how retailers can gain better insight into customer buying patterns by visualizing their location-based data such as customer loyalty data, even data purchased from 3rd party vendors. thincSoft will also demonstrate how retailers can integrate planograms with measurement data to create a more visually-based performance analysis directly integrated with the merchandise planning process. thincSoft will also show how retailers and CPG manufacturers can extract more value from their RFID investments by leveraging thincTrax - a visually-intuitive way to track assets using any technology (RFID, GPS, WiMax, etc.).
