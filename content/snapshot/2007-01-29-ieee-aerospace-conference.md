For anyone who'll be in Big Sky MT on March 5th, I'll be presenting at the [IEEE Aerospace Conference](http://www.aeroconf.org/) my paper on [An AJAX Collaborative Geospatial Visualization framework](http://blog.andyeick.com/2007/01/09/GeoBoosttrade+An+AJAX+Web+20+Collaborative+Geospatial+Visualization+Framework.aspx).  Just got my confirmation this morning!
