Any amount of traveling, and you learn that nothing goes as planned.  I was in San Mateo for a meeting late last week, and I had to catch a very early flight back east to get home in time for a meeting that afternoon.  I had asked the front desk to call me a taxi, and they assured me it would be ready, but no taxi was outside the lobby when I went to at 4am.  There was nobody at the desk, and I had already locked the room so I couldn't get to the Internet.  I remembered seeing this video, so I gave it a try.  "San Mateo, Taxi" and I was connected straight away, and then off to the airport I went!

Program 1-800-GOOG-411 into your phone, you never know when you'll be stuck outside a hotel room at 4 in the morning needing to get a cab to the airport!
