I now have [Peter](http://www.andyeick.com/gallery.aspx?tag=peter) added to the [family tree](http://blog-family.andyeick.com/2007/03/18/Family+Tree.aspx) on [geni.com](http://geni.com), so hopefully he'll expand the family tree with more names.  We're up to 163 people -- I need to get Denise to add her family -- [these are some old pictures](http://blog-family.andyeick.com/2007/02/08/Denises+Childhood+Pictures.aspx) she found...  If anybody else wants access to the tree, just [contact me](http://www.andyeick.com/Administration/Contactme.aspx).

 

BTW, Pete scanned all of Dad's old slides (several gigabytes worth), and I've been uploading them to my site.  He's agreed to scan all of Dad's Mom's pictures as well (sucker) --- A couple of shoeboxes circa 1920's
