<div>Jasmine understood that "PRAAAA-SAAAANNNNTTT" was something to be opened.  Any package or bright thing she saw, PRAAA-SSSEEEENNNNTTT.  Of course, she&#039;d open it and didn&#039;t know what to do then.  Libby had no such problem.  She needed Jazz to help her open it, but after that, she understood it was a toy.  Every doll she got she&#039;d look and say "BAAA-BEEE" and then proceeded to carry them around with her the rest of the day.  Jasmine got a &#039;kitchen&#039; -- after she saw it she ran around saying "I cook dinner, i cook dinner." while Libby got a doll house.  The doll house is bigger than her, but she loves to put her babies (Polly Pockets" in them.  I think one of the fav&#039;s from this year was a bird that Carol got them that sang "Happy and know it"  It&#039;s amazing how well those things sound now (it&#039;s probably a little MP3 player inside it".  Over and Over and Over again they press it&#039;s hand so they can hear it sing and see it jump.</div><div>Both girls got pretty sick over the holidays, caught whatever was going around.</div>
