[![Alamo, San Antonio](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/1761953089_46827d0208.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/19429588@N00/1761953089/ "Alamo, San Antonio")Just got back from [Geoint Symposium 2007](http://www.geoint2007.com/) in San Antonio, Texas.  The little town of San Antonio is cute, with the river (and river walk) winding it's way through the town.  The riverwalk was lined with bars and restaurants which really was pleasant.  Just the fact that it was 'below street level' got us out of the way of the cars and roads, made for a fun evening of meandering between bars.  We stayed a 10 minute walk from the convention center in a hotel that was a converted jail.  Bexar County Jail was the county jail from 1878 until 1962.  Of course, this being Texas, the first thing they talked about was the last execution carried out in 1921.  They also took pains to point out where the execution room was, and elevator shaft where the "body drop" took place.  The rooms were converted jail cells -- you could still see where they cut the bars out of the window...

It was interesting seeing the map of Mexico from that time frame though -- Mexico claimed all of Texas and up into Wyoming --

The show was a great success, and we were able to demonstrate our technology to several potential customers and clients.  I have a long list of follow up contacts that I need to execute on!

Kurt and Colin work to get the demo's working in our booth...



Below are 2 portraits I snapped of Alex and Mike the last day.  Since I didn't bring my real camera (I was traveling heavy already) the portraits I took of the rest of the crew didn't turn out --- next time!
