What would  a [visit to Korea](/2007/06/30/Korea+Visit.aspx) ([sideshow](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/sets/72157600278651874/show/)) be without getting a handmade tailored suit!  I went to GQ tailor, right outside of Osan.  I was not expecting very much, but he did an amazing job on the tailoring.  I've spent more on sweaters than I did on that suit, but I must say, it fits better than any of my other's.  I also bought a custom shirt.  I'm telling you, once you have a custom fit clothes, it's hard to wear any others.  The best is that he has my measurements on file, so I can order anytime via email.  Mr. Bo's GQ Tailor -- Highly recommended -- they do great work.
