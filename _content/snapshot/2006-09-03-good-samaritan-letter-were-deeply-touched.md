[![Read the letter](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/GoodSamaritanLetterWereDeeplyTouched_AD2D/GoodSamaritanLetter1Sep062.jpg)](http://www.andyeick.com/_blogMedia/GoodSamaritanLetter1-Sep-06.pdf)Steve Eick Again. Weâre deeply touched that a [Good Samaritan](http://www.andyeick.com/_blogMedia/GoodSamaritanLetter1-Sep-06.pdf) has kindly offered to resolve this case. [Read the text of the letter here.](http://www.andyeick.com/_blogMedia/GoodSamaritanLetter1-Sep-06.pdf)  We really appreciate this generous act. At some point I hope to repay this kind act for somebody else. If my first contact with Ms. McCarthy had been something other than a court summons, I think this dispute would have gone a different way.  For a history of this dispute see [here](http://blog.andyeick.com/2006/08/31/Almost+Settled+The+IPod+Dispute+On+Judge+Mathis+TV+Show.aspx), [here](http://blog.andyeick.com/2006/08/31/No+Music+For+Shannon+Ms+McCarthy+Turns+Down+IPod+And+ITunes+Gift+Certificate.aspx) and [here](http://blog.andyeick.com/2006/09/01/The+Pot+Calls+The+Kettle+Black+What+Happened.aspx).  Who is morally wrong?   Q. Stephanie for returning the iPod to Shannonâs Dooney & Burke designer purse (while she was in the room) rather than handing it to her?  Q. Shannon for leaving her purse and iPod unattended while she went to the bathroom and them blaming Stephanie, the kid who put the iPod into her purse, rather than whoever took it?  Q. Melanie McCarthy for filing a lawsuit against her daughters friend before contacting Mr. Eick or conducting an investigation to find who really took it or how it was lost? Ms. McCarthy for not accepting any of the three settlement opportunities?  Q. Stephen Eick for not (paying for) or forcing his daughter to pay for the iPod when somebody else took it? (He offered to pay $100 or pick up a refurbished iPod for Shannon on eBay.)  Q. The news media for reducing a she-said she-said between teenagers into sound bytes and hyping it into an international media event? Neil Steinberg for turning a misunderstanding between 8 graders into a lesson in morality and a lecture on class?  Q. The kid who really took the iPod and is probably a friend of both Shannon and Stephanie?  There are two sides to every fence. Letâs examine both sides of the fence before jumping to conclusions.     tags: [iPod](http://technorati.com/tag/iPod), [lawsuit](http://technorati.com/tag/lawsuit)
