posting here so I can find it later when I need to debug it....

 {% blockquote %}  - Make sure that IIS is configured to use _Integrated Windows Authentication_. Look for the checkbox on the Authentication Method dialog launched from the Directory Security tab of the site properties.  

- Make sure that _HTTP Keep Alives_ are enabled. You'll find that checkbox on the Web Site tab of the properties dialog, in the connections section.  

- This one is strange, but it seemed to do the trick for many out there, add <i>http://localhost</i> to the trusted sites in Internet Explorer. To tell the truth, this seems to be a fix for the symtoms, not actually fixing the problem itself, but if it works it works. BTW, you'll have to uncheck the âRequire server verification (https:) for all sites in this zoneâ checkbox to add it as a trusted site.
