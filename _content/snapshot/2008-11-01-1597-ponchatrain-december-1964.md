That is our Okemos home.  My first sabbatical was '64-'65. We spent fall '64 in Los Alamos and came through E. Lansing mid December on our way to NYC to board a boat to Europe.   We rented the house that year.  We came back late August '65 and bought the E. Lansing house you grew up in Dec.'65, as I recall.
