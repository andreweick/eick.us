[![](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/ChicagoTribuneEricZorn_127D0/backtoschool8.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/67603667@N00/230549832) Although the story is a great sound bit, as [Eric Zorn](http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/) points out, the truth is complex and isn't as tidy a morality play.



Stephanie told me that the first day of High School eye witnesses came forward and were able to trace the iPod from when Stephanie placed it in Shannon's purse to when Shannon left the room.  It sounds like the parents talked to the reports before everyone talked to the kids to find out what happened.

**[![](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/ChicagoTribuneEricZorn_127D0/zorn%5B6%5D.png)](http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/) UPDATE**-- In comments, Stephanie's father, Stephen, asks us to look at these blog posts:

- [The Pot Calls the Kettle Black -- What Happened](http://blog.andyeick.com/2006/09/01/The+Pot+Calls+The+Kettle+Black+What+Happened.aspx) 

- [Almost settled the iPod dispute on Judge Mathis TV Show!](http://blog.andyeick.com/2006/08/31/Almost+Settled+The+IPod+Dispute+On+Judge+Mathis+TV+Show.aspx) 

- [No Music for Shannon - Ms. McCarthy Turns Down iPod and iTunes Gift Certificate ](http://blog.andyeick.com/2006/08/31/No+Music+For+Shannon+Ms+McCarthy+Turns+Down+IPod+And+ITunes+Gift+Certificate.aspx)



But still. Given this contention, the neat edges of the morality story are gone. It turns into yet another "whom do you believe?" story instead of a "what do you believe?" story. Way less interesting, in other words; one for the judges and lawyers, not the armchair moralists. Darn it.
