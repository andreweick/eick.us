Sunset

 

 

 

I went to Hawaii for work a few weeks ago, and finally got them downloaded from my camera.  I must say I'm disappointed in myself that I wasn't able to take any better pictures, but I suppose I was there for work, and didn't make an effort to get out and concentrate and making images.  (I did get plenty of opportunity to get out and spear fishing with my buddy Chris, well, I went diving, er floating, Chris went spear fishing....)

 

 

 

I wasn't patient enough with the light, and got only a few pictures that I liked....Of course, I left Hawaii, and went on to Asia, where I didn't even take one picture, so I suppose I did much better in Hawaii...
