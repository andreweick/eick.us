From the author of *the best* computer book evah, (Code Complete, by Steve McConnell)  a new set of lists about software construction.  I love the one about trusting the map more then the terrain.  So often I've seen projects that aren't accomplishing anything, but the team insists that "The Project plan says we are right on schedule."

 

I tell my engineers, "When you're unsure what to do, do a lot, something is bound to be correct." (and "Don't confuse activity with progress.")
