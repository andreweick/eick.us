[![Unsoldered](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/2146640051_7eb69ed044_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/49503210249@N01/2146640051/ "Unsoldered") With the amount of time I spend traveling, I keep my "go bag "pretty light, but I think I have an extra set of batteries in there.Â  I'll have to double check before my next trip (January 2nd) and make sure though, I've given enough to the TSA already!

Effective January 1, 2008, the following rules apply to the spare lithium batteries you carry with you in case the battery in a device runs low: 

         - **Spare batteries** are the batteries you carry separately from the devices they power. When batteries are installed in a device, they are not considered **spare batteries**. 

      - **You may not** pack a spare lithium battery in your **checked baggage** 

      - **You may** bring spare lithium batteries with you **in carry-on baggage **&#8211; see our spare battery [tips](http://safetravel.dot.gov/tips.html) and how-to sections to find out [how to](http://safetravel.dot.gov/how_to.html) pack spare batteries safely! 

      - Even though we recommend carrying your devices with you in carry-on baggage as well, if you must bring one in checked baggage, you **may** check it with the batteries installed.
