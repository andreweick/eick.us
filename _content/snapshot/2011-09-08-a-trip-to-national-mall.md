A quick trip down to national mall.  First we stopped at the National History Museum which had this ridiculous statue of George Washington as a greek god.  Shows that america was really struggling with how to memorialize our distinguished citizens.  It seems that no one really liked the statue, so they had the washington monument built (even though the earthquake tried to knock it down)....
