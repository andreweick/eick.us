[![](http://www.andyeick.com/_blogMedia/HellogoodbyetoethicsiniPodage_A74A/steph_thumb4.jpg)](http://www.andyeick.com/_blogMedia/HellogoodbyetoethicsiniPodage_A74A/steph6.jpg) Although I know this is a columnists, and meant to be glib and light reading, I think the way he enumerated the attorneys (Juxtaposing a Mother and Daughter against a 5-name law firm) was unfair.  When you go to court, you have an attorney, I actually think any interaction you have with the law you should have an advocate, and would expect everyone to be represented by an attorney.  A while back there was a picture of a Detroit police officer making an arrest in full Armour and weapons, and there was a public outcry.  I kept thinking, "this is 2006, this is what Police look like, they don't look like Barney Fife."  The same here, I would expect attorney's, so why point it out, other than he was trying to create an under-dog. 



Another part of the article I was surprised by was when he pointed out that Stephanie "is posing on the cover of the Naperville Sun, grinning happily and showing off the new video iPod..."  Having never been photographed for the paper, and not being a 14 year old girl, I'm guessing here, but I think I also would try and smile and look my best, probably from nervous energy knowing my picture would be in the paper. (And I think the iPod was a Christmas present, but I suppose 8 month's old is 'new')



But I quibble, as I said, I know he's a columnist and just trying to be glib.
