Shannon's mom, [Melanie McCarthy, says](http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=local&id=4481456) "it is not just about the iPod, but the principle, so she and her daughter are demanding $475 from the Eicks, $350 for the iPod, the music and the case, along with $125 in court costs."  



**What principle?** I don't care who you lent your iPod to. You don't leave it where someone could steal or lose it. I'm not a lawyer or anything, but McCarthy certainly doesn't have a case. You can't sue someone you asked to watch your personal belongings. It's not their responsibility. I know of a freshman who left her Creative Zen on a school bus after a soccer game, but she didn't go and take the bus driver or bus company to court. It's not their fault she forgot about it! I just don't understand why people can't take responsibility for their own actions. Own your mistakes people, otherwise you're going to go through life blaming everyone for being unhappy.  



Shannon goes on to say: "I put my trust in her and I thought she'd take care of it. She should have held on to it till third period or waited and given it to me after class." NO...you should have remembered to go back to class to retrieve your nano, not blame your friend for not holding onto it for you.  



Why are kids bringing their iPods to school anyway? Leave them at home where they are safe.
