 {% blockquote %} #### Mom would rather sue than get new Ipod

[![](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/ipod.jpg)](http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/ipod31.html)I am shocked at this mother's behavior. First, why are you letting a child bring something worth almost $500 dollars to school? Yes, it is very unfortunate that the iPod got stolen, but what would you expect? The girl returned it, I'm sure she doubted something this horrible would happen. She's basically still a child and teens aren't exactly known for thinking things through.

 

Instead, she has drawn this battle out, putting both her daughter and the other girl under scrutiny. The mother has some responsibility for letting her child bring an iPod to school. What is this teaching the children? If something goes wrong, sue?
