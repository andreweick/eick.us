![](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/520769410_82bfd96881_m.jpg) This my just be the developer in me coming out, but just like to have everything neat and tiddy (all my classes deconstructed, all my transactions committed).  So I tried to make one [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/AndrewEickCombined) that contains all my digital leavings.  Currently I have my [family blog](http://blog-family.andyeick.com/) ([RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/AndrewEickFamily)), my [professional blog](http://blog.andyeick.com/) ([RSS](http://feeds.feedburner.com/AndrewEick)), and my [tumble blog](http://tumble.andyeick.com/) ([RSS](http://tumble.andyeick.com/rss)) (not to mention my [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/), and [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/aeick)).  I used yahoo pipes to combine all the data into one feed.  Pipes has a fun interface, but I think they missed the mark in terms of ease of use -- using terms like "union", "for each annotation", and "[regex](http://tumble.andyeick.com/post/2654233)" they've kind of limited the user base to programmers, and if your a programmer, you write a simple script to combine the feeds anyway....

 

 

 

It is a fun interface though!
