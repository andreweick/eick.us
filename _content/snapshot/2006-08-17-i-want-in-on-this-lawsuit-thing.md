Remember that time when a young girl lost her friend's iPod, and the parents of the young girl sued that other little girl for losing that electronic item?  



Oh yeah, it happened yesterday ... in Naperville.  



Stephanie Eick, 14, of Naperville, is being sued over the loss of her friend Shannon Derrik's iPod after it was stolen from a Still Middle School classroom on the last day of school this spring.  



The 14-year-old, who is beginning her freshman year at Waubonsie Valley High School, is being sued for $475 after she said she left it on Derrik's desk.  



Most parents might be disturbed by the extreme action, but I say let's hit that 9th grader in the pocket. Let's make sure all that money they make â baby-sitting and doing chores â goes toward justice.  



In fact, this litigious action is an inspiration for the rest of the confused and frustrated parents across the country, who have no idea how they should handle their children's problems for them.
