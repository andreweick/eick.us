[![image](http://www.andyeick.com/_blogMedia/DoNotCallRegistry_E070/image.png)](https://www.donotcall.gov/)If you signed up for the National [Do Not Call Registry](https://www.donotcall.gov/register/reg.aspx) when it opened up in 2003, you need to re-register, as the 5 year window of valid registrations is expiring ---  If only the [CAN-SPAM act](http:/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/canspam.shtm) were this effective in cutting down unwanted interruptions....

  

 

  

p.s., I just put our number on the do not call registry -- the web site had an .ASPX extension, and no viewstate...

  

 

  

I hope I remember in 5 more years to register again!
