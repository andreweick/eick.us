I'm at the Microsoft MVP summit.  They had poorly curated corporate art, but the piece of the Berlin wall in the lobby was pretty cool.  Although the individual pieces of art were good, there was no overall personality to the exhibit. While I was in Seattle the [Dalai lama and Bishop Tutu](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004351882_dalailama16m.html) were having a meeting in the next conference room over.  The security around the facility was high, and many followers and handlers were working on arrangements for the meeting.  Surprisingly, the followers of each religion (Dalai Lama, Bishop Tutu, MSFT) were very similar.

Which way, right or left?  Seems so simple a choice in retrospect....
