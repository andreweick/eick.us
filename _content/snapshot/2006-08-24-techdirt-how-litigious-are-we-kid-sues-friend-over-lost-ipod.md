Now that the story has been in [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/23/14-year-old-girl-sues-friend-over-missing-ipod), it has been picked up world wide.  I agree with this blog post -- I wish the (teacher or principal) would have been contacted that day so that the real culprit could have been found.  I'm sure if they would have rounded up everyone in the room that day, someone would have seen something....

### How Litigious Are We? Kid Sues Friend Over Lost iPod

 

A [14-year-old girl has decided to sue her friend](http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/23/14-year-old-girl-sues-friend-over-missing-ipod/), after the friend screwed up in returning the iPod she had borrowed. Rather than handing the iPod back to Shannon Derrik, Stephanie Eick placed the iPod on her friend's school desk, where some other thief in their class pocketed the device. Rather than working it out between themselves (or hunting down the thief), Shannon went to court.
