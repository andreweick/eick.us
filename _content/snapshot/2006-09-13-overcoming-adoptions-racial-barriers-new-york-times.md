I suppose adoption stories always resonate with me! ([Adopted daughter](http://andyeick.com/gallery.aspx?tag=Jasmine), [Biological daughter](http://andyeick.com/gallery.aspx?tag=Libby))  Reading the chart, it looks like I'm one of 10,000 with a Asian adoption.  Jasmine is from Xi'an, and the year I was there the China government only allowed 100 girls from the providence, and Jasmine was #96. 



What I can't understand is why society is putting any restriction on adoption when so many children need homes.  Let's have this discussion after every available child has been adopted and cared for.

By [LYNETTE CLEMETSON](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/lynette_clemetson/index.html?inline=nyt-per) and RON NIXON



When Martina Brockway and Mike Timble, a white couple in Chicago, decided to adopt a child, Ms. Brockway went to an adoption agency presentation at a black church to make it clear they wanted an African-American baby.



Their biological daughter, Rumeur, 3, is accumulating black dolls in preparation for her new brother or sister. Black-themed children’s books like “Please, Baby, Please” by the filmmaker Spike Lee and his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, share shelf space with Elmo and Dr. Seuss.



But the couple’s decision provoked some uneasy responses. One of Mr. Timble’s white friends asked, “Aren’t there any white kids available?”
