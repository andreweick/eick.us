A picture of mine from South Korea was used in the video "A Year in The Life of Flickr."  I'm May 12th.  I liked a few of the pictures, but I have no idea how mine got in there (it's not even one I like!)  I think my friend Charlie took the snap. 

  

The night was fun though, we were having sushi in South Korea, and it was really yummy. I remember being really cold, wearing a sweatshirt, and my knees were hurting from sitting on the floor mats...
