My buddy Jason and I were really at MIX08!  

  

 

  

I saw this picture [on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/mix08) (tagged with MIX08), and thought I looked familiar.  Notice the conference tarp man-bag to the right -- not a very good schwag-bag, but my daughter totally loves it, and uses it as her [diego rescue pack](http://www.nickjr.co.uk/shows/diego/index.aspx).

  

Hmm, how many women can you count in the picture?
