So, I’m trying [Grand Central](http://www.grandcentral.com/) for my phone.  The idea is pretty clever, it’s one-layer indirection for your phone.  It allows you to have one phone number, and you can route any incoming calls to any other phone number you want.  I use this number as my ‘public number’ (recruiters and such).



So GrandCentral just launched a new feature — the idea is that you type in your phone number, and the service will call ‘your’ number and connet it to ‘my number’ — Any of my friends, feel free to call me through the internet!
