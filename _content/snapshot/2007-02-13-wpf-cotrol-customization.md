[![revolUXions](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/388628564_ec67e676cc_m.jpg)Dax](http://ux.nukeation.com/), I was working on the example from our [last video](http://ux.nukeation.com/default.aspx?episode=2), and “the developer” in me came out.  (You know, the developer who can’t draw a straight line with a ruler and whose every dialog box had the gun-metal-grey look and feel?)I was wondering if XAML somehow has ‘inheritance or something similar to CSS.  The buttons [in the screencast](http://ux.nukeation.com/default.aspx?episode=2) looked great when you did them, but when I tried to draw them, well, it didn’t look so nice.Is there a mechanism to externalize that design?  Can you (the designer) make a button and then package the look and feel into an external file that I (a developer) can just include in my project?<span style="color: #ff0000;font-size: small">Update: 2007-02-13 </span>[<span style="color: #ff0000;font-size: small">Dax</span>](www.nukeation.net)<span style="color: #ff0000;font-size: small"> explains how </span>it’s done<span style="color: #ff0000;font-size: small">!</span><span style="color: #810081">[![revolUXions download](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/downloadbutton.jpg)](http://ux.nukeation.com/default.aspx?episode=2)</span><http://ux.nukeation.com/default.aspx?episode=2><div class="bjtags">Tags:  [revolUXions](http://technorati.com/tag/revolUXions), [ux](http://technorati.com/tag/ux), [vido](http://technorati.com/tag/vido), [wpf](http://technorati.com/tag/wpf), [wpf/e](http://technorati.com/tag/wpf/e), [xaml](http://technorati.com/tag/xaml), [expressions](http://technorati.com/tag/expressions)</div>
