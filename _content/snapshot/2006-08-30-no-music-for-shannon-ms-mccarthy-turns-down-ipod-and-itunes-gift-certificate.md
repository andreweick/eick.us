[![](http://blog.andyeick.com/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/NoM.McCarthyTurnsDowniPodandiTunesGiftCe_149FD/ipod%5B5%5D.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/77758445@N00/102816664)[Steve here again](http://blog.andyeick.com/2006/08/31/Almost+Settled+The+IPod+Dispute+On+Judge+Mathis+TV+Show.aspx) -- Today, a generous Good Samaritan dropped a new iPod and iTunes gift certificate off at the Naperville Sun (the local newspaper who broke this international story) for Shannon Derrik, the 14-year old who lost her iPod. The anonymous women, in a thoughtful act, wanted to resolve this dispute and get Shannon an iPod. What is really weird is that Ms. McCarthy, Shannonâs mother, turned down the generous gift. Wow, poor Shannon. According to earlier reports, Shannon had worked long and hard to save $200 for an iPod, spent her own money to buy it, and was distraught when it was lost. I thought the reason she is suing us is to get her iPod back. Evidently thatâs not the case. This dispute is apparently about something else. Ms. McCarthy, Shannonâs mother, has turned down $100 from me (offered on **the first and only time** I spoke with her), a new iPod and iTunes Gift Certificate from an anonymous stranger, and an opportunity to be on Reality TV where everybody wins. I feel sorry for Shannon. Between my $100 and what Ms. McCarthy paid in court fees Shannon could have had her iPod. Shannon could have gotten her iPod today and she missed out on the opportunity to be a (paid) TV star tomorrow. Disputes between parents are fine, but letâs keep the kids out of it. Please, Ms. McCarthy, let your daughter have the iPod. She doesnât need to be part of this dispute.   tags: [ipod](http://technorati.com/tag/ipod), [lawsuit](http://technorati.com/tag/lawsuit)
