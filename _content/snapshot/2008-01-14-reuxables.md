[![](http://reuxables.nukeation.com/slices/logo_small_web.jpg)](http://reuxables.nukeation.com/) [Nukeation Studios](/admin/Pages/www.nukeation.com), a leader in Windows Presentation Foundation™ (WPF) and User Experience (UX) solutions has released reuxables, a range of designer themes for Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2008 and Microsoft Expression Blend™.     Reuxables themes are aimed at the fresh new market of WPF applications, and allow software developers to easily implement a new look for their applications with lots of features: 

     - The reuxables library consists of 6 fully customizable themes, each with their own unique variations that result in a total of 48 different styles. 

    - The themes are designed by some of the top artists in the UX design industry. 

    - Reuxables themes provide a consistent look regardless of the operating system, and therefore provide the same look on both Windows Vista&#8482; and Windows&#174; XP. 

    - Reuxables are completely compatible with both .NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5. 

    - All reuxables themes are provided in both Static and Animated versions, both made from native XAML vector objects. 

    - Implementing reuxables is effortless as they automatically theme the entire application as soon as the theme file is added to the project. 

    - Reuxables themes are fully compatible with both Microsoft Expression Blend&#8482; 1.0/1.1 and Visual Studio&#174; 2008. 

   

   System requirements include Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 or 3.5 for runtime, and Microsoft Expression Blend 1.0/1.1 or Visual Studio 2008 for development. Individual reuxables themes are available between $19 to $99, with an additional complete collection pack for $299.     A complete demonstration of all themes is available at: [http://www.reuxables.com](http://www.reuxables.com) 

  

Dax also made some screencasts demonstrating how easy it is to drop reuxables into either [VS2008](http://go.nukeation.com/?ec=reuxvs2008video) or [Expressions Blend](http://go.nukeation.com/?ec=reuxblendvideo)....
