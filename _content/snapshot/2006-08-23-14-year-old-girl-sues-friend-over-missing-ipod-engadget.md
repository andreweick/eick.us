I _SOOOO_ thought of live-blogging the trial already.  I can see it now, the sobs when a picture of the missing iPod is displayed, the audible gasp from the gallery when the tunes from the missing Pod are enumerated maybe even a murmur that the judge gavels down ("Order! Order in this courtroom!") when a counter explanation is offered  ("I submit to you, that the iTunes are not in fact missing, the are, in fact, on the host computer even as we speak!")

A spat over a missing iPod resulted in a lawsuit in Wheaton, Illinois, when 14-year-old Shannon Derrik sued her (now former) friend Stephanie Eick for losing her brand new iPod. 

 

Ryan and I will be headed to Wheaton next month to liveblog the entire trial, we really have no choice to put all our resources into coverage of a case of this magnitude.
