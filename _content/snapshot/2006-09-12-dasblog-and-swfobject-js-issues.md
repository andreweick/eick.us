I tend to use [SwfObject](http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/) for my Flash / HTML integration needs.  It handles the "click to activate" issue with I.E., it's 2 lines of script, and it isolates me from the  &&  ickiness of flash.  Although I did get around the "click to activate" anomaly, I could no longer login to the site.  I was getting a "Object Expected" JavaScript error in Login.aspx.

 

There must be some name collision in the variables that was overwriting an expected value or such -- I switched to the [DHTML method](http://www.nukeation.net/2006/08/05/Workaround+For+The+CLICK+TO+ACTIVATE+Irritant.aspx) (_thanks [Dax](http://nukeation.net/)!)_  and everything works swimmingly.
