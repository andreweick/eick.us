The State of Wyoming used Dad's photograph (from 1978) of Medicine Bow for the [states tourism website](http://wyomingtourism.org/).  Peter scanned in all of Dad's old slides, and I've uploaded them all to the [website](http://flickr.com/photos/andreweick/tags/slides/)  (there are a bunch of them).  I'm amazed at how well they held up (the earliest photographs are over 50 years old)

Here's the original.

Personally, I like this one better.  Maybe because you can see the station wagon in it...
