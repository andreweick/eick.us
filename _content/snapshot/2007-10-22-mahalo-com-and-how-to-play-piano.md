![](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/1486093856_3e40460f42.jpg)Mahalo.com is a cool site that is a "human powered search engine."  They are trying to leverage the wisdom of the crowds to help you find content that is missed by the googlebot.  They use real editors to make a taxonomy of content filtering out the spam links and deceptive sites to focus on valuable content.  Rather than rely on google-juice they rely on human-juice.  I haven't tried the site yet, but an editor used one of Creative Commons photographs in story about how to play piano.  It was a picture of Morgan and AJ I took at Becky's house a few summers ago...
