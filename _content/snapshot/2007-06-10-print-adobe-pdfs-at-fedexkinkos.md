I just saw [this](http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/06/06/adobekinkos/index.php) and thought Adobe had a really clever idea.  The new version of Acrobat Reader will have a "Print at Fedex/Kinkos" button backed right in.  When [I was at Ford](http://blog.andyeick.com/2007/03/21/FoMoCo+No+Mo.aspx), I was always pushing for a similar idea.  We used to spend a boat load of money duplicating and distributed our service manuals to all the dealerships, and I thought the money would be better spent by electronically delivering the manuals, and then printing them locally ad-hoc.

 

I had thought that Ford was big enough (or at least back then, when our stock was over $50) to broker an agreement with one of the printing shops to make it easy (and cheap) to print the books locally to the dealership.  Just think how much we could have saved in shipping alone!

Of course, Acrobat is the closest thing to a virus I know (Does anybody know how to get rid of the "~/Documents/Updater5" directory?).  Opps, I take that back, QuickTime is a virus, Acrobat is the number 2 virus.  Install either of these applications, your machine will never be the same...

 

 

 

I hope the "print at Fedex/kinkos" works, if only to validate my idea 10 years after the fact.
