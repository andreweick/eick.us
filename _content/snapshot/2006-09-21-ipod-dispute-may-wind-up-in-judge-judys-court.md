The dispute that arose when an Aurora schoolgirl lost her beloved pink iPod after loaning it to a friend is due in court today in DuPage County.  



But a California judge who is watched by millions of television viewers may end up having the final word.  



Both sides tentatively agreed to fight it out on the âJudge Judyâ show, which airs weekdays on WBBM-TV, Channel 2.  



The national exposure is the latest twist to an overblown teenage quarrel that generated a lawsuit, a media frenzy and thousands of Internet forum opinions.
