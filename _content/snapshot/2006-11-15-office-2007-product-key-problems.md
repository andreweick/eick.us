**Update: 2006-11-15**  I just had to cal MSDN for another issue -- the recording said the keys should be available Tuesday Nov. 22....

I called the phone number to activate groove, but now my OneNote is "not genuine", so I can't install any add-on's. I tried to call for MSDN support, but couldn't get anywhere....  ###### Office 2007 Product Key Problems 

 Seems there is a bit of an issue with the MSDN Product Keys for Office 2007.  Several of the Office products share the same Product Key issued by MSDN; "Office 2007 Desktop Programs" is used for Groove. InfoPath, and OnNote and both Project and Viso share another one.  When I went to activate the assorted application on my workstation it failed for InfoPath, OneNote, and Project (Groove and Visio activated without a hitch). After some looking around I was able to find a thread in the managed MSDN newgroups on this topic. Looks like several users have reported this problem.
