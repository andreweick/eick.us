My niece is involved in a [silly little lawsuit](http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/sunpub/naper/news/6_1_NA16_IPOD_S10816.htm) (she is the defendant).Â  Since [Apple own's "Pod"](http://news.com.com/2100-1030_3-6105789.html), do they have rites to this lawsuit?

{% blockquote %}
The week before Stephanie Eick and Shannon Derrik begin their freshman year together at Waubonsie Valley High School, they will get a firsthand look at the DuPage County judicial system all because of an iPod.  

The dispute started with the two Still Middle School friends sharing an iPod (a portable device that plays music) and has resulted in a lawsuit with Stephanie, 14, as the defendant.
