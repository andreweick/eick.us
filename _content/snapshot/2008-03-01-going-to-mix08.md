[We've](http://www.thincsoft.com/) been doing a bunch of Silverlight work lately, so I decided to go to [MIX08](/admin/Pages/www.visitmix.com/2008) in Las Vegas.  I've been traveling so much that I really didn't want to getting on a plan again, but after today's snow storm, I'm looking forward to a few days in the 'lost wages'! 

  

If anyone else out there is going to be at MIX, [drop me a email](/contact.aspx), we'll meet-up!
