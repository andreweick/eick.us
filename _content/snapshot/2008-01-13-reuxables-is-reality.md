My buddy and [podcast-partner](http://ux.nukeation.com/) [Dax](http://www.nukeation.net/) has released [reuxables](http://reuxables.nukeation.com/), a theme framework for WPF applications.  Dax has been working with WPF and Silverlight since pre-alpha, and has had a passion for UX development forever.   Something that I've always struggled with as a developer is the fact that my UI's are either boxy (tr's and td's) or gun-metal-grey win-form's.  While Dax kept [telling me](http://www.nukeation.net/PermaLink,guid,41f5e735-bef0-4450-a476-22cf9b5a6b5c.aspx) how easy it was to add a little style to interfaces, the best I could ever do was to send him my HTML, and he'd send back something that looked awesome.   With reuxables, through the magic of inheritance and injection, you code up your WPF application, and then select the theme.  Every control on the page is auto-magically themes--- professional UX's at a fraction of the cost --- wow.  I wish I would have learned earlier in my career how important the UX is -- when you are briefing the boss, they need to see a good looking UI, or you won't get your next funding cycle.
