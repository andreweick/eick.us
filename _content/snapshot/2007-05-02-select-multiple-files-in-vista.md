I upgraded to Vista on my tablet a while ago, so I had forgotten how to enable this (hidden) feature.  The new explorer has tick boxes next to the file to enable multiple selections -- in XP, you selected multiple files by holding down the "ctrl" key.  (Holding down the control key is rough on my tablet that doesn't have a keyboard).

To enable this option, select "organize" and then "Folder and Search options", and then select the option from the "View" tab as shown below.

A pretty nice feature to be as hidden as it is!
