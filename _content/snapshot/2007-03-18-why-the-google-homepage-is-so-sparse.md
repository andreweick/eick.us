As [Steve](http://www.sss-research.com/about-us.aspx#SteveEick) always tells me, try not to focus on the fringe of the problem… Google was focusing on search, not HTML…

{% blockquote %}

The prime reason the Google home page is so bare is due to the fact that the founders didn't know HTML and just wanted a quick interface.
