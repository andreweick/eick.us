[![Iwo Jima](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/1439532203_223cba8180_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/19429588@N00/1439532203/ "Iwo Jima")[Russ](http://www.the-definite-article.net/) and I had a meeting in Washington D.C. yesterday.  Although I've been to D.C. hundreds of times, I've only seen the insides of conference rooms and airports (BWI, IAD, DCA).  My flight out of Reagan National wasn't until late, and I had an extra half hour in the schedule.  As I was driving around looking for a gas station before I returned the rental car, I looked over and saw Arlington National cemetery.  Rather than sit in [DCA](http://www.mwaa.com/national/) bar, I decided to walk around the park for a tick.  It was about 1900 (7pm) so the sun was just setting.  It's a nice park, with a great view across the Potomac of the Capitol.

I took these pictures with my camera phone, so they didn't turn out very well!

Next time I'll go across the river to the Washington memorial (and maybe I'll remember my camera!)
