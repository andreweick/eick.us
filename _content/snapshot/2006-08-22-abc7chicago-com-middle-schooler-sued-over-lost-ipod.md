Steve's on TV!  He should have been wearing a ThicSoft.com | SSS-Research.com shirt (or at least an andyeick.com   lapel pin!)  I think you have to go to the site [here](http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=local&id=4481456#) and then click 'watch the video'

Shannon McCarthy says she lent her iPod to a girlfriend and then left class to go to the bathroom. The classmate, Stephanie Eick, says she listened to one song and left the iPod on Shannon's desk before leaving class herself. But Shannon never went back to that classroom and the iPod disappeared. Now both girls are in court over who should pay for the lost music player.  



Stephanie's father, Steven Eick, left his daughter at home Monday.  



"I think it's inappropriate to bring kids into court, and I think there are much better ways -- I was shocked that someone would litigate against a 13-year-old over an iPod," said Steve Eick, defendant.
