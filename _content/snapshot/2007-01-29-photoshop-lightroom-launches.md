I've been using this program for a few months now in beta and it's working out pretty well.  I have thousands of images that I have scattered around, and Lightroom has done a decent job of trying to tag and manage them.  Although it says for the professional photographer, I am far from it -- I'm just looking for a digital shoebox to allow me to tag and find my images quickly.  A bit pricey at $299, but for the sale price of $199 (sale ends April 30, 2007)....Now if they just had an SDK so I could write a [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick) plugin...

New AdobeÂ® PhotoshopÂ® Lightroomâ¢ software is the professional photographer's essential toolbox, providing one easy application for managing, adjusting, and presenting large volumes of digital photographs so you can spend less time in front of the computer and more time behind the lens.
