The federal government did a study on telecommuting and found positive results for both the employee and employer.  I agree, although it's tough to make a business case for avoiding an hour in traffic, it is a big mental relief to get up and know I don't have to deal with traffic.  In the past, my employers have been open to the idea of telecommuting, but hard times they've leaning back to the old ways....I can't imagine how they are going to attract talent with 1950 style view of knowledge workers.

The positive impact telework can have on an employee's reduced commuting time, effort, and costs; increased productivity; and increased control over the delicate act of balancing work and personal responsibilities is tremendous. Benefits to the organization, including the increased ability to recruit and retain valuable employees, gain higher productivity, and experience boosted morale, are clearly documented. Reduced commuting serves to benefit the environment by fewer pollutants being dispersed into the air, and less wear and tear to roads and vehicles.  



In summary, the prevalence of telework continues to grow and progress in the Federal Government with over 140,000 eligible Federal employees (19% of the total workforce) taking advantage of the opportunity to work from alternative worksites. Telework is an important human capital tool, presenting agencies with significant opportunities for increased organizational effectiveness. For those Federal agencies maximizing its application, telework can reap substantial benefits when integrated into the routine business practices of the organization.
