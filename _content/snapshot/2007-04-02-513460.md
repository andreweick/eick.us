{% blockquote %}It was a pleasant cafe, warm and clean and friendly, and I hung up my old water-proof on theÂ  coat rack to dry and put my worn and weathered felt hat on the rack above the bench and ordered a cafe au lait. The waiter brought it and I took out a notebook from the pocket of the coat and a pencil and started to write.{% endblockquote %}Ernest Hemingway
