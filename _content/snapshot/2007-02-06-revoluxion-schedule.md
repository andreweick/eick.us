[![](http://ux.nukeation.com/slices/revoluxions_white.jpg)Episode #1](http://ux.nukeation.com/ "revolUXions") is out of the way, on to episode #2.



[We](http://www.nukeation.net/) [learned a whole bunch](http://www.nukeation.net/2007/02/06/revolUXions+Update++Schedule.aspx) in the first episode, and we're incorporating [feedback](http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com/?p=650). The biggest comment was to allow download's of in a format other than .EXE. Currently, you can (now) download a WMV of the program, and we (should) have a flashy (WPF/E) player on the site to allow viewing right online. We'll have the directly!



We've been brainstorming the next few shows (Well, [Dax](http://www.nukeation.net/) has been brain, [I've](http://blog.andyeick.com/) been storming), and here's a tentative schedule….



**February**

1. Let me WOW you with blend 

2. Control Customization 

3. DataTemplates in Detail (aka, Return of the Flickr App) 

4. Useful Animations 



**March (yes, we become two-times-a-week)**

1. Let&#039;s take a whack at Codename "WPF/E" 

2. The Developer + Designer Integration Story 

3. A great resource for Resources (ResourceDictionaries) 

4. WPF Applications in the Browser 

5. Using Aero Glass
