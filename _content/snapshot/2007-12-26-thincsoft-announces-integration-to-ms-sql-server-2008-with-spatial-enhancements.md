**  thincSoft Announces Integration to SQL Server 2008 With Spatial Enhancements **



_Visual Intelligence(TM) Application Combines Business Intelligence (BI) With Location Data To Provide Enterprise-Wide Location Intelligence Solution_ 



**Lisle, IL- November 12, 2007** – thincsoft, a provider of Visual Intelligence software applications today announced that its thincVIew and thincTrax products now support Microsoft SQL Server 2008 for generally available customer applications.  



“The demand for location intelligence solutions continues to grow,” said Mike Profita, thincSoft President.  “As we continue to penetrate new markets, we have seen more demand from customers to connect to a Microsoft technology infrastructure.  The spatial enhancements of SQL 2008 deliver a significant performance increase and enable us to continue delivering enterprise-wide location intelligence solutions to our customers.”



A recent survey indicated that over 80% of data maintained by corporations has a location component; another survey indicated growing demand for location-based data across organizations, often from non-traditional users of such data.  This growth is driven primarily by the value provided by linking key business intelligence data with location data to create greater organizational insight.  



“Microsoft places a great deal of importance on our partner ecosystem,” said Kim Saunders, Senior Director of SQL Server Marketing at Microsoft.  “With thincSoft’s Visual Intelligence suite utilizing the spatial enhancements in SQL Server 2008, they can take advantage of the latest SQL Server technology to help deliver pervasive Enterprise Business Intelligence solutions to their customers.” 



thincSoft’s suite of Visual Intelligence (VI)TM software is available as a fully-configurable Web 2.0 enterprise solution for corporations and as an OEM solution for software vendors and systems integrators looking to enhance current BI, geospatial, or RFID/Asset Tracking solutions with a location visualization and analysis component.
