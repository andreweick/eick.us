I found the best Sushi place in DC -- a little place in Old Town, Alexandria -- [Momo's Sushi](http://mymomosushi.com/) right off of [Queen Street](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=momo+sushi+old+town&ll=38.807644,-77.041476&spn=0.010885,0.018947&client=safari&oe=UTF-8&fb=1&gl=us&hq=momo+sushi+old+town&cid=0,0,16902355595661083222&t=m&z=16&iwloc=A).  I was looking for office space to rent and saw the place across the street.  

Unfortunately the office space wasn't as good as the fish.
