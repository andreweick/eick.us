Must have been a _very_ slow news day in Naperville.  I'm not sure what new facts are being reported.... The anonymous letter is [here.](http://blog.andyeick.com/2006/09/03/Good+Samaritan+Letter+Were+Deeply+Touched.aspx)

 {% blockquote %} #### It's an iPod impasse

A donated iPod most likely is headed back to the store after an Aurora woman declined to accept the gift, which was intended to resolve a dispute.  



On Thursday, a generous benefactor returned to The Naperville Sun to retrieve the iPod and other gifts that she had hoped would put to rest an ongoing court battle. The anonymous donor brought the iPod Nano to The Sun office on Aug. 30 with instructions that it be given to Shannon Derrik, 14.  



In June, Shannon loaned her iPod to her friend Stephanie Eick, 14, of Naperville during the last day of eighth grade at Still Middle School. Though what transpired next is in dispute, initial reports indicated that Stephanie placed the popular music-playing device back on Shannon's desk, from where it was believed to have been stolen by an unknown third party.  



The anonymous donor said she most likely will return the iPod Nano to the store, but she thinks she is stuck with the gift certificates and possibly the pink case. She said she had hoped that Shannon would have accepted the iPod to end the dispute.  



Both sides are due back in court on Sept. 21.
