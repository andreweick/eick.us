I remembered this pub from when I was there so much when I worked for Ford 10 years ago.  The pub dates back to Shakespearian time.  (Well, in actual fact it was rebuilt.  A fire destroyed it in 1676, so they had to rebuild it on the site).  I shouldn't be surprised that the pub is there 10 years later, seeing as it's been there for over 300 years!

There are many small rooms (maybe 10 tables and a fireplace) with bars in each of them, and a common courtyard in the middle of the tavern where the traveling showman used to stage plays.  This is where Shakespeare would go and stage plays for the benefit of the drinkers.  Shakespeare's globe theater, in fact, is two or three blocks down the Thames.  Back then, the south bank of the river was the bad section of town (Where actors and playwrights would frequent), but now it is the middle of London. 

It took quite a walk to find the place from Westminster to Southbank (in that I really didn't remember where it was), but I found it by the tower bridge tube station down an alley between two buildings.

In case I forget where it is for next time I'm in London, go to the London Bridge tube station, and ...
