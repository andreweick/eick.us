I was trying to find an old photograph, and I found this one last night.  I took this when we went out to visit [Carol in San Diego](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/sets/72157594567294923/) in April 2006.  Carol had so much fun with [Libby](http://andyeick.com/gallery.aspx?tag=Libby) and [Jasmine](http://andyeick.com/gallery.aspx?tag=Jasmine).   This was taken on the beach on Coronado and Jasmine was still _very_ afraid of the water.  Jasmine would only look at the ocean if Carol held her (look how Jazzy looks!)  [Libby had no such fears](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/175304649/) and ran right into the surf.
