I’ve started to construct a family tree on-line using [geni.com](http://www.geni.com/demo). (Shout out to Mary Margret for the help on her side of the family!) — if any of my family are actually reading this, and want access, [contact me](http://www.andyeick.com/Administration/Contactme.aspx), and I’ll add your name to the list of people who have access to it!  



It’s fun to add your information (and any information you know about), and it seems that every grandchild has contacted Dad for ancestry information for school projects lately….



We’ve got 110 people added so far!
