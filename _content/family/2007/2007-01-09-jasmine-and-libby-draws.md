[Jasmine](http://www.andyeick.com/gallery.aspx?tag=jasmine) is getting better at drawing, she likes to experiment with the colors.  She says she likes the sprinkle best -- she used to be scared of it.  [Libby](http://www.andyeick.com/gallery.aspx?tag=libby) still can't use the stylus, but she likes to make dots with it....
