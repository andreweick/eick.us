I haven’t used my Canon 10d in quite a while, well since I bought the 5D to be precise!  I was packing up for my trip to Montana to the IEEE Aerospace conference, and I decided to take my ‘little camera’ and a small lens.  (I really didn’t want to haul my camera and lens out there!)



I was charging up the battery, and I saw that these pictures were on the memory card — they were taken during Christmas…



Many cookies that really didn’t last that long…
