Happy Birthday Libby -- 3 years old.  We had the party for her this weekend, but Jasmine already told me this morning that Libby has more presents to open today. 



Jasmine also told me that she will act surprised when she opens her soccer ball, and she offered to help Libby open presents as well Jasmine-"'cause we need to share, daddy."  Daddy-"Can Libby share with you on your birthday?"  Jasmine-"No thank you."
