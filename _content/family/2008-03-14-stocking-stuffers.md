They used one of my pictures on [Mahalo.com](www.mahalo.com)!  This picture of the girls first Christmas from a few years ago.  Look at Libby, already grabbing for the candy -- if I would have known 3 years later she would still be eating only candy for dinner...![](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/2322703280_37b4b119cb_o.gif)Original:[![Stockings are hung by the chimney](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/175253102_1232873799.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/175253102/ "Stockings are hung by the chimney by AndrewEick, on Flickr")Some more pictures from that Christmas.  Libby is biting the ribbons.[![The bow is the best](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/175253413_c4afaa68c4.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/175253413/ "The bow is the best by AndrewEick, on Flickr")Libby is biting Jasmines legs rather than open presents (Don't worry, Libby, she get's you back when you are three)[![A Bite or a Kiss](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/175254093_0bdc9029a1.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/175254093/ "A Bite or a Kiss by AndrewEick, on Flickr")[Source:](http://www.mahalo.com/How_to_Choose_Stocking_Stuffers)
