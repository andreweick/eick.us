Dad took this picture in 1959, I wonder why he was there.  Or more accurately, I wonder what academic conference was there?  Let's see, [Carol](http://liblab.net/eick/?p=135941185) would have been 5?  I know my 5 year old (Jasmine) would be saying "This is  **SO** **BOOOOORRRRRRRRRIIIIIINNNNNGGGGG**, Daddy!"[![boardwalk at atlantic city](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/336388321_d8b8ac629a.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/336388321/ "boardwalk at atlantic city by AndrewEick, on Flickr")
