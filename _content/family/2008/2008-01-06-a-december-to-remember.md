It was quite a week for them, first Christmas Eve (The whole drive home on Christmas Eve, Jasmine kept looking into the sky asking 'Will Santa still come to our house even if I'm not home yet?')  Jazz was worried that she wouldn't get home in time and Santa would skip her house.  She made me open the "sky window" (sun roof) in the car so she could keep watching the sky.  When we got home I showed her [the Santa Mapper](http://www.noradsanta.org/) and Santa was still over Virginia, so she raced to bed.  Libby (of course) was already lights out.  Jasmine wanted to put out Milk and Cookies for Santa, but I told her that Santa got Milk from all the other houses, and that she should put out a shot of Jack Daniel's if she wanted extra presents.  She was torn, so she decided to put out both the milk and liquor.

One of the big presents they opened was a pirate ship.  Jasmine loved it and dressed up right away and looked out her telescope ("I spy you daddy!")  Libby tried to put on the pirate custom, "but it's to ugly", so she decided to be the princess that the pirate kid-a-napped.

Princess Libby kidnapped by pirate Jasmine



My nephew Marc and Natalie got married on December 28th.  The girls were flower girls in the wedding and had so much fun!  I was a little worried that the girls would be to scared to walk down the aisle, but with Maria there, they had no problem.  I sat in the front so that they had a target to run towards, and they did.  Of course the most fun they had was at the reception dancing.  I'll post the videos as soon as I can!
