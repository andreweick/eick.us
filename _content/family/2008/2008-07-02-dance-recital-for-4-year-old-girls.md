Libby and Jasmine had there dance recital a few weekends ago.  Libby loves dance, Jasmine not so much.  Jasmine has decided she wants to do gymnastics next, and Libby is going to follow.  I keep trying to talk Libby into staying with dance another few years, but no such luck.  I'm sure she will keep dancing around the house though (complete with telling me "clap!" when she strikes a pose so that she can curtsey...)

My dad took a video of the concert.  I think he had a little bit of trouble at the beginning finding the girls in the line...
