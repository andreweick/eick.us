Took the girls up to our cottage in northern Michigan for the 4th of July.  Yes, I know, I am terribly late posting these photos.  You would have thought digital photos would be quicker to process, but it seems to take me much longer to get them downloaded from my camera and posted to the interweb.

 

 

 

For the last few years they've shot fireworks over Long Lake, so we can stand on the beach and watch them.  The girls didn't get as scared of the big fireworks as I thought they would.  It's great to be able to sit and watch the show, and then walk into right into the house!

 

 

 

The cherry festival was also the same weekend, so we took the girls cherry picking and to the carousel in downtown traverse city.  Libby named all the horses (Her's was named Cimeron -- the Indian horse), Jasmine's was probably named Shasta (the snow dog)
