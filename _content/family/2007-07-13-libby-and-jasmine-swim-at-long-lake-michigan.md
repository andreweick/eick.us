We just got back from the cottage in Traverse City.

The girls had so much fun swimming!Last year Libby was afraid to even go into the water, and this time she kept would go in and splash.  [![Libby climbs out of Long Lake](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/788733699_14bb43baca.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/19429588@N00/788733699/ "Libby climbs out of Long Lake")

 

 

 

Jasmine had fun "playing like a boy, daddy".  Taylor, Brendan, Jasmine, and Morgan played a game of keep away, and the boys weren't afraid to tackle.  Of course, Jasmine would just wait until the two brothers started fighting, and then would go and grab the ball.

Before, they wouldn't even set foot on the boat, and this year, they would run back and forth.
