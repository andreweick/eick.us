We took the girls downtown to see the Nutcracker the day before Christmas.  Libby had so much fun she was beside herself.  She wanted to tell us that she knew every dance, and which of the 'ballet moves' she could do.  They brought a friend from school and afterward, since the theatre was right on National Mall, we went out to see the National Christmas Tree.  It was much smaller than I thought it should be, Libby even said the National Candles were bigger than the tree.
