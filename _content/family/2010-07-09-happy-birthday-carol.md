I certainly miss talking to [Carol](/blog/2006/12/04/carol-anne-eick-july-9-1955-november-27-2006/), and today would have been her birthday.  Although I'm sure she missed me, I expect she misses Jasmine and Libby more -- these two pictures were taken when Carol came to visit in 2004.  The last two pictures are from our visit with Carol in San Diego in 2006
