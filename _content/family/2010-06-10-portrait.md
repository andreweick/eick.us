Jasmine wanted to take some pictures, so I decided to take pictures of her taking pictures.  And then Jasmine wanted to try the big camera -- she could barely hold it up, much less steady, but she did get one photograph made.  After Libby was done practicing piano, she had to do exactly whatever Jasmine was doing, but really she just wanted to pose.  I taught her a 'posing trick' (before you get your picture taken, look down, and then quickly look back up at the camera), so she practiced that all night.
