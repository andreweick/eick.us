We went to New York City the day after thanksgiving. We went up only for the weekend. Libby was really excited to see a broadway show and the [Radio City Music Hall Rockettes.](http://liblab.net/eick/blog/2011/11/28/libby-draws-the-rockettes/ "Libby draws the Rockettes") I don't know which Libby liked more, seeing The Lion King or seeing the dancing. I know Jasmine liked the Lion King (even the scary parts). We stayed right on times square, and I think Jasmine liked the crowds. Libby could not even believe that we saw [Naked Cowboy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Cowboy) (she thought that her friend had made it up, that somebody would stand around with words written on their underwear!)We went saw the sites around midtown, ate at the signing diner, and came back to DC before the traffic started up. Next time, Libby wants to see Mary Poppins.
