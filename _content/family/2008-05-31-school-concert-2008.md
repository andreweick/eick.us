Jasmine (age 4) and Libby (age 3) had their school concert a few weeks ago.  The theme was international, so the girls wore the dresses I bought them in Korea.  They had so much fun signing the songs -- Libby still calls every flag she sees a 'grand 'ole flag."  The first picture sums up the girls right now.  Jasmine is desperately trying to figure out what she is suppose to do next, and Libby doesn't care what she is suppose to do next.
