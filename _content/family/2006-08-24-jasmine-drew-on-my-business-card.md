If Jazz is a good girl all day (and only terrorizes Libby early enough in the afternoon that I forget (Voices from other room:  Libby: "WAHHHHH, WAHHH, WAHHHHHHH!!!!!"  Jasmine: "OH, SOOORRRYYY 'IBBYY.  SOOOORRY, SOORRRY 'IBBY)) I let her draw before she goes to bed.  Tonight she wanted to draw on one of [my business](http://www.sss-research.com) cards.  I asked her to draw [AJAX GeoSpatial Positioning](http://www.sss-research.com/products.aspx), or [Hypothesis Visualization](http://www.sss-research.com/products.aspx), but this is what she came up with.  (3 years old might be to young to access talent, but maybe photography is her thing....)
