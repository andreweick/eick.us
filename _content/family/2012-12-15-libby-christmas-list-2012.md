[^1]: I told Libby that there was no way Santa could read her writing, and she had to read it to me to type

[^2]: Right now she is using a shawl that Jasmine made.  Except when she can't find the dolls shoes, and then she wraps her foot in the shawl

[^3]: American girl doll

[^4]: She has to get the mini dolls because they don't make them anymore

[^5]: She made me promise to forget this as soon as I typed it

[^6]: Whatever you do, don't tell Jasmine, Libby is trying to keep this one item a secret from her!
