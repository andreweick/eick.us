Jasmine got a hand me down iPhone (a 3G, not a 3GS) and she plays with it constantly.  She lost it for a couple of days, and when I asked her where it was she said "Little kids shouldn't have iPhones anyway, Daddy."  Of course, now that she found it again, she plays with it all the time....She made this self portrait with the camera the other day...
