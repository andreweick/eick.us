We went to Michigan to visit the day after Christmas, and it was so cold!  The difference between 35 and 15 is more then 20 degrees!  A few good snapshots...The girls both got 'stand up' horse toys.  The horses are big enough for them both to sit on and ride...[![Libby and Jasmine on standup horses](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/4300378283_3051e89d6f.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/4300378283/)Jasmine opening a present in Traverse City[![Jasmine opening a present](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/4301128858_fc4218c879.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/4301128858/)Dad in front of the Christmas tree[![Dad in front of tree](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/4301126988_35e79cf8b9.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/4301126988/)We went to the Greenfield village museum, and they had a lego exhibit that the girls liked -- one of the models with short depth of field.[![Lego street model](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/4301132250_4d8a0b9b52.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andreweick/4301132250/)full set
