Opening presents.  Girls were so excited, Jasmine could barely sleep.  She kept jumping up and down trying to contain herself.  Jasmine did hear the jingles of the sleigh when Santa left, but didn't hear him downstairs bringing presents.  The night before Jasmine was plotting out the course Santa would take from the fireplace to the tree (video to follow), and Libby had to count out 9 baby carrots for each reindeer.  The big presents were American Girl doll beds and nightgowns (with matching nightgowns for the girls), Easy Bake things, and a sewing machine for Jasmine.
