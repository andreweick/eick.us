[![Jasmine  and Libby Draws on daddy's putter](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/199985570_8eae8c1d53_m.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/andreweick/199985570/)After the girls take a bath, Jasmine usually wants to "Draw on Daddy's 'puter? O.K."  (Jasmine has a habit of asking a question that hasn’t been asked, and then give the answer)  I let her draw on my tablet pc — it’s a regular laptop with a touch sensitive screen so that you can write on top of the screen.  It’s even pressure sensitive, so the harder she presses, the darker the lines get.  Look at the blow up, and you can see how hard she is pressing down!

She sits and colors designs until it’s time to brush her teeth.
