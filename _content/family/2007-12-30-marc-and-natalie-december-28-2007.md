<http://www.flickr.com/photos/19429588@N00/2149531764/>My nephew Marc got married on Friday, and Jasmine and Libby were flower girls.  The girls walked down the aisle no problem, and had a lot of fun at the reception.  My mom just called to see the pictures, but I've just now downloaded them from the camera,  so I have a bunch of editing to do -- here are a few quick ones I saw though....
