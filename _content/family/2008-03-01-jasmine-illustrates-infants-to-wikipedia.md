A picture I took of Jasmine in China was used by [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant) to illustrate infants....The picture was taken a few weeks in -- I think I had already left Xi'an and was in Guangzhou waiting for her US Passport and papers.  The first couple days were rough, but by this time in the trip we had bonded, and she knew she was stuck with me.  She was even starting to play a little.  They had a very nice crib at the hotel ([The White Swan](http://www.white-swan-hotel.com/eng/Public/index.asp)).   The hotel was right next door to the American Consulate, so there were many recently non-orphaned babies / families milling about.  I had to take her to the "doctor" here, and she did not like that what so ever, and then waited for the paper work to be finished.  But that time of the trip I was ready to go home.  I remember that was the first time in 2 weeks that I could go to a restaurant (I didn't feel comfortable in Xi'an), but Jasmine would squirm to much for me to eat (and heavens knows I couldn't put her down).  That whole time I didn't once think of getting take-out (I mean they invented those little boxes for take-out Chinese food, no)?
