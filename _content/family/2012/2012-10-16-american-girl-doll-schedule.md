Libby has a strict schedule on who is to change the dolls each night and morning.  

I thought she'd get tired of it (Jasmine did), but 10 or so months later, she still bugs Denise or I each night to change them, and every morning she lays out what clothes she wants them to wear.

After they are changed, she lines them up on the couch while she goes to school...
