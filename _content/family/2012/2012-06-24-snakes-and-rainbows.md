Jasmine writes a poem in for school

### Slime
{% blockquote %}
Snakes are very slimy, scary, and yucky  
Lizards climb trees and change colors  
I know many slimy animals in the world  
Me, I do not like slimy animals in my bed  
Everyone I know is a fan of slimy animals.
{% endblockquote %}


### Rainbows
{% blockquote %}
Rain, rain go away, let the sun shine today!  
Awesome!  Look at all the colors in the sky  
I am not scared of Boo! Boo! I scared you!  
INeed to look out for Boo, do not let the leprechaun scare you  
Oh, how about we run up the hill and see what's up  
Wow!  Look at the pot of gold we are rich, very, very rich  
{% endblockquote %}
