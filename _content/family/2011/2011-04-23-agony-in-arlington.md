3 months ago Agony came out to visit in D.C.  It was the middle of winter (see the snow piled up in the pictures?) and I think he got pretty cold.  His meeting was 15 minutes away from my apartment in Alexandria, so it was easy to pick him up and take him to the house where he could drill the girls on math.  We went to national cemetery one of the afternoons.  While we were there we saw a full military funeral with horse drawn caisson, 21 gun salute, and fly over.  Very moving....
