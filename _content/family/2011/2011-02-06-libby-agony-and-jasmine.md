Agony came for a meeting in the District, and stopped by the house a night or two.  (We also went to Obama burger, which Jasmine would have liked, Libby, not so much).  I really didn't take a bunch of pictures, just this one mostly out of focus one.  Agony helped the girls do their homework and math flashcards, which Jasmine loved...
