I'm having trouble uploading my video, so I'll try again.This is Jasmine and Libby surfing with my friend Chris in Hawaii.  Jasmine took to it right away, and even rode with Chris out past the breaker wall and into the big waves.  There was a surfing competition going on while we were in Waikiki beach, so Chris took Jasmine into the big waves.  She loved it, but the judges asked them to leave.Libby was able to stand up on the board, and liked the paddling around
