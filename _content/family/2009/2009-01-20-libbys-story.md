Libby's story that she told the other day....

 {% blockquote %} 

One day there was a skunk called "Pet Shop" and she lived in a cave.  She sprayed the t-rex, but never a mommy or daddy person or kids.  One day, there was a t-rex who was outside.  She sprayed her whole spray all over the t-rex and she got some more at the skunk gas station and "Pet Shop" lived happily ever after.  The End.
