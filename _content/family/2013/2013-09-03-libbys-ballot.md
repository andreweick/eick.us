Libby and Jasmine's first day of school was today.  Jasmine just wore T-shirt and shorts, while Libby had a fashion show to help her pick out which one to wear.  Even after the votes were tallied, she made clear to everyone that the vote was to *help me decide* what to wear, not *really* what to wear. She wanted a non-binding resolution.  

Jasmine practiced raising her hand at breakfast this morning because she wasn't sure she remembered how to.  (Is it palm outwards toward the teacher?  or sideways?  She couldn't remember -- it's been a long summer!)
