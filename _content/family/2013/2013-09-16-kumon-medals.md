Libby and Jasmine showing Kumon medals. Kumon is extra math and reading problems that they do for extra drill of school work.  I don't remember the specifics of why Libby won a trophy and Jasmine medals, but it had to do with Libby being at a higher level (relative to her grade level than Jasmine). Libby can do well in school, but it's hard to keep her motivated to work (probably like [Agony][1] when he was in grade school?)
