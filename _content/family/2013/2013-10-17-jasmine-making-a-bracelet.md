Jasmine really likes doing crafts, and lately she has been doing rubber band bracelets.  She really wanted to make a video to put on youtube, so we made it last weekend.  She also picked out the music, the title animations and typefaces, and really had fun making the video speed up through the boring parts.  She even worked really hard trying to get the music to fade in and out at just the right moments, she would make me go back and forth and then jump up right when she wanted the music to stop.
