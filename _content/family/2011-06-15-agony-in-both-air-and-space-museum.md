We took Agony to the Air and Space museum (The one out by Dulles, not the little one downtown) -- it was so much fun going through with Chris because he was able to tell us about each of the engines, and why they were important.  I haven't downloaded the photographs from my camera yet, the space shuttle was just an iPhone picture.
