Took the girls to the parade downtown yesterday.  The parade was down constitution ave, and it was really hot.  The girls went into the natural history museum (to the gift shop, no doubt) while I held our seat along the parade route.  Libby liked the bands and the balloons, but was tired soon enough.  Of course, not to tired that a Popsicle didn't revive them.  We walked down to the white house, and then got on the subway home.  They wanted to see the fireworks, but Jasmine was sound asleep before the fireworks even were finished on t.v.I made the attached movie on my iPhone, and edited it together on the subway ride home --- I didn't have any marching band music in my music collection, so Miles Davis will have to do...
