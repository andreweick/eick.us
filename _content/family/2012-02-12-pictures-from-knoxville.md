It was a quick trip down and back to Knoxville, but I was able to take a few pictures at the [restaurant](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=1667695142762556885&q=Calhoun+in+Knoxville,+TN&hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=36.059646,-84.188232&spn=0.000278,0.000343&t=m&z=12&vpsrc=6).  Hopefully our research proposals get funded and I'll be installing a dataspace on that giant computer!  (Jasmine would be much more impressed with the worlds biggest computer if it were an iMac the size of a building.)
