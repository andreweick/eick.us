Libby and Jasmine drew pictures for me before I left for D.C.  I think every picture Jasmine draws has a doggy in it.  Libby is just learning to draw her family.Jasmine draws family and dog (age 5):[![Jasmine draws a Family and dog](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/3562548133_8c5227813e.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/19429588@N00/3562548133 "View 'Jasmine draws a Family and dog' on Flickr.com")Libby draws Jasmine, Mom, Libby, Jasmine, and Dad.  I guess we have five people in the family know.  I am surprised she didn't draw one her imaginary friends...(Age 4)[![Libby's Family](http://media.eick.us/2011/05/3563362998_0873e84709.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/19429588@N00/3563362998 "View 'Libby's Family' on Flickr.com")
