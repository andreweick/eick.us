*Opps, I thought I had posted this months ago (we took the trip in January!, but I guess it's been in my "outbox" ever since....*Went to see my friends from university to go and see a Hockey game at the old U.  Tony (sorry, Anthony, old habits die hard) got us tickets right on the ice.  The first time the players slammed each other into the boards, Jasmine got so excited.  Jasmine loves taking pictures in the first place, so she sat and took pictures the whole game (most of the pictures of the hockey game Jasmine took).  Libby was tired from all the swimming, so she mostly fell asleep after eating the obligatory (for Libby) popcorn.  I'm not sure if the girls liked the swimming pool or the hockey game, but I know they liked playing with the other kids....Pics:
