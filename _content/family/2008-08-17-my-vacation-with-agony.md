A few weeks ago I spent the weekend with my brother Agony (aka Chris) at the cottage in Traverse City.  Uncle Agony played with the girls and Becky's kids for hours...We took the girls cherry picking, swimming, boating and to the beach.  Mostly, though, we just ate ice cream at [Moomers](http://www.moomers.com/), and played in the water at the cottage.  A perfect Michigan weekend (seeing as we get about 2 good weekends a year)
